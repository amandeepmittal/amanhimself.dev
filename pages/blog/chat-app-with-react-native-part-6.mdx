In [part 5](https://amanhimself.dev/blog/chat-app-with-react-native-part-5), we successfully connected real-time database service Firestore to store chat messages in a collection where each collection would represent a separate chat room. Further, we built sub-collections in each chat room collection to store and identify latest messages from all other messages in a chat room.

This part is going to be a bit different. Instead of writing code to communicate with any real-time service, we are going to fix a bug by creating a custom hook.

Here is a screen shot of the type of bug I am talking about it. Notice how the status bar remains dark in color on both lighter and darker backgrounds.

Do notice that the status bar looks fine when the background is light in colour. This happens when the modal screen to create a new chat room is displayed. But on rest of the screens, when chat rooms are displayed or inside a chat room, the status bar does not matches well with the coloured background of header on both of these screens.

React Native has a core component in its API called `StatusBar` that is used to control the app status bar behavior and its styles. However, manually adding `StatusBar` to each screen is not our goal in this tutorial.

The navigation library `react-navigation` is going to help us to solve this. We are going to create a custom hook that is going to track the status bar color and change it accordingly whenever a screen changes. That is, on the lighter background, a dark status bar is displayed and on a darker background of the screen, a light status bar is displayed.

To begin you need `react-navigation` library to be installed. Since we have already done that in [part 1](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/chat-app-with-react-native-part-1-build-reusable-ui-form-elements-using-react-native-paper-75d82e2ca94f) of this chat app series. If you just came across this tutorial, please have a look at part 1 and instructions mentioned on how to install and configure `react-navigation` library.

Otherwise, you can follow the instructions from `react-navigation` library official docs [here](https://reactnavigation.org/).

## Create a custom Status bar hook

The `react-navigation` library provides a hook called `useFocusEffect` that helps to run side-effects when a specific screen is focused. A side effect can be described as fetching data, updating a title, running an event listener and so on. This hooks is similar to `useEffect` hook from React with the difference being between the two is that side-effects in `useFocusEffect` run only when a screen component is focused.

Let us begin to develop this custom hook. Create a new file called `useStatusBar.js` inside `src/utils/` directory. Import the following statements.

```js
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { StatusBar } from 'react-native';
import { useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/native';
```

Export a custom function called `useStatusBar`. This function is going to be act as a custom hook that is going to provide a simple way to change the color of the status bar when applied. Pass the `style` as the only parameter for now. The value of the style is going to be determined on the screen component this hook is used.

```js
export default function useStatusBar(style) {
  useFocusEffect(
    useCallback(() => {
      StatusBar.setBarStyle(style);
    }, [])
  );
}
```

It is important to wrap the `StatusBar` with `React.useCallback` hook to avoid triggering the side-effect after every render when the screen is focused.

## Application of the custom hook

To apply this hook for the first time, open `screen/HomeScreen.js` file, import the custom hook and apply it as shown below.

```js
// rest of the import statements
import useStatsBar from '../utils/useStatusBar';

export default function HomeScreen({ navigation }) {
  useStatsBar('light-content');
  // rest of the code remains same
}
```

Go back to the simulator and you are going to notice the changes now.

It works. If you look closely at the header bar of the `Home` screen, you are going to see that the status bar has the value of light styles applied. However, this style is also applied to all of the other screens, even on those screens such as `AddRoomScreen` where a darker status bar would be preferred.

![ss3](https://miro.medium.com/max/714/1*JSa1Ndh9tYt4BzdBUJG4mA.gif)

To fix this, you have to explicitly mention the styles of the status bar for each component using the custom hook we created in the previous section.

```js
/**
 * screens/AddRoomScreen.js
 */

// rest of the import statements
import useStatsBar from '../utils/useStatusBar';

export default function AddRoomScreen({ navigation }) {
  useStatsBar('dark-content');
  // rest of the code remains same
}

/**
 * screens/RoomScreen.js
 */

// rest of the import statements
import useStatsBar from '../utils/useStatusBar';

export default function RoomScreen({ route }) {
  useStatsBar('light-content');
  // rest of the code remains same
}
```

Now, go back to the simulator and you are going to find everything is in order and works as expected.

## Animate the value for smoother transitions

For better transitions between different screens in a stack navigator, you can pass the second parameter to the `useStatusBar`. This second parameter is going to be called `animated`. Passing a default value of boolean true is going to help and avoid any explicit mentions. Otherwise you can explicitly pass the value of the parameter as well.

```js
export default function useStatusBar(style, animated = true) {
  useFocusEffect(
    useCallback(() => {
      StatusBar.setBarStyle(style, animated);
    }, [])
  );
}
```

The animation used by the hook itself is going to the default transition of native platform the app is currently being run since the hook `useFocusEffect` is imported from `@react-navigation/native`.

Now you can go back to the simulator (_the below demo is using iOS simulator_) and notice the difference between the previous section and this one.

## A last challenge

The purpose of this series is to make yourself familiar with integration process of Firebase in a React Native app and implementing a navigation flow with `react-navigation` library and how to use components from `react-native-paper` UI library. This purpose is now complete with this part.

Though I leave you with a small challenge. Implement the logout button in the header bar of the Home screen. Just like you have used the `IconButton` component from `react-native-paper` to open a modal screen. Hint, changes are to be done in the `HomeStack.js` file and we have already written the `logout` function in `AuthProvider.js` file.

Here is a little demo showcasing what has to be implement:

Try to do it yourself and try to think other ways you can implement log out functionality in this app. If you feel stuck or want to jump ahead to the the GitHub commit [**here**](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/react-native-examples/commit/b1383ccc9fca20214b6c91bfe5a2a5d72a1f8d16).

Otherwise, you can find the complete code at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/react-native-examples/tree/master/ChatApp).
