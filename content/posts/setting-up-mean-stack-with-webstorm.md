Ever since I got interested in Node.js and started learning to program in JavaScript, both the programming language and the server side platform have been most relevant to me. Due them, I have made my first PR to an open source project on Github, heck, I even built one of my own using them (_see_ [_#100DaysOfCode_](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/100DaysOfCode-twitter-bot)) which currently has more than 6 people actively contributing and enhancing it.

With Node.js, from quickly building server side application to build fullstack application is not much of a hassle. There are two important solutions to this:

- MEAN Stack
- Meteor.js

### MEAN Stack

MEAN Stack is the used to create complete web development solutions. With JavaScript it’s base, it has lot of advantages to offer and the important of all is one programming language both on server and client side. No context switching. A perfect fullstack solution for me personally.

MEAN is an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js. So instead of learning four different programming languages, you just need to know JavaScript.

### Setup MEAN Stack in Webstorm

I am sharing a video here which shows on how to get started with MEAN using JetBrain’s Webstorm (_A JavaScript IDE_) by [John Lindquist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=JnMvok0Yks8).
