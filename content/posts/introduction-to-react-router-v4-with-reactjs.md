React is often used for building single page applications (SPAs). SPAs tend to have multiple page views. When navigating from one-page view to another, reloading the entire page view is a tedious and not so efficient task. In fact, it diminishes the benefits of a SPA. To work as it should, a SPA must render parts of views when required instead of reloading the entire page.

Routing comes into the picture when navigating from one page to another in a SPA app. Routing can be categorized in two ways. Static and dynamic. SPAs follow a dynamic approach. In this tutorial, we will discuss a popular routing library used with React applications known as [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start).

**Requirements**

- NodeJS `v8.x.x` or higher installed along with npm/yarn
- `create-react-app` installed globally to on your local dev machine generates a new React project

_Bonus_: You can also, use `npx` to generate a new React project without installing `create-react-app`.

## Getting Started

To create a new React project run the following command at the desired location on your local machine.

```shell
create-react-app react-router-v4-demo
```

Once the project is generated, traverse inside the newly created directory. This strategy is the default way to generate a new React app.

[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) as a library contains three different npm packages.

- react-router
- react-router-dom
- react-router-native

Each of the packages has a different use case. The first one, `react-router` is the core package and is used with the next two packages listed above. The `react-router-dom` has to be used when building a web application. This is what we are going to use in this tutorial. The last one, `react-router-native` tends to be used in a [React Native](https://hackernoon.com/getting-started-with-react-native-in-2019-build-your-first-app-a41ebc0617e2) application.

To add React Router in the React app, execute the following command from a terminal window.

```shell
yarn add react-router-dom
```

Please note that, for the rest of the tutorial, we will be using `yarn` as the JavaScript package manager to add or remove dependencies. If you wish to use `npm`, there is no one stopping you.

To run the React app, go to the terminal window and execute the command npm start. This will start the development server. You will be welcomed by the default boilerplate project screen in a web browser window on URL `http://localhost:3000/`.

## First Route with React Router

To create the first route in the React app, let us import `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` library.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
```

To create a route, we use `<Route>` from the `react-router-dom`. This is where the logic of routing is placed. It renders the UI of a component. A `<Route>` has a prop called `path` which is always matched with the current location of the app. On the basis of this prop, the desired component gets rendered. When the component is not getting rendered, `Route` returns null. The component name is also passed as a prop `component`. Look at the below snippet.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" component={Home} />
    </Router>
  );
}
```

There is the functional `App` component that returns a `BrowserRouter` which holds the very first `Route` component. The `path` is currently pointing towards the `Home` component which has the following UI logic.

```js
function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, visit the URL on port `3000` and you will see the `Home` component being rendered right now.

![ss2](https://crowdbotics.ghost.io/content/images/2019/05/ss2.png)

This is a bare minimum example. Now let us add another route with the same props as the `Home`. Call this route `About` with a similar rendering logic as `Home`.

```js
function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now add this functional component as the second route, below the `Home` route. Also, add both routes inside a `div` element. A router component can hold a single child element and adding a `div` solves this problem and allows the router component to have as many children as we want.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <Route path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

Try visiting the URL `http://localhost:3000/about`. You will notice that both the components are being rendered right now on the path `/about`.

![ss3](https://crowdbotics.ghost.io/content/images/2019/05/ss3-1.png)

The reason for this is that regular expression engine that React Router uses internally considers both the routes that are being started with a forward slash `/` equal. To solve this issue, we can use another essential prop on the Home route called `exact`.

```js
<Router>
  <div>
    <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
    <Route path="/about" component={About} />
  </div>
</Router>
```

This exact is also known as a qualifier which states that the path must match the exactly the `/` and nothing after it, such as `/about`. Now, if you visit the browser window at the URL `http://localhost:3000/about` you will notice that only the about component is getting rendered this time.

## What is BrowserRouter?

Do you remember reading earlier about that `react-router-dom` is used only in case of web applications? Well, `react-router-dom` library holds two types of routers API for a React application to use. One is called `BrowserRouter` that you have seen in action in the previous section. The other one is called `HashRouter`.

A `BrowserRouter` will always listen to URLs like `http://localhost:3000/about` whereas a `HashRouter` will have `http://localhost:3000/#/about`, as the name suggests, uses a hash `#` in between. So why did we use the `BrowserRouter`?

`BrowserRouter` is a popular choice among modern day web applications. The main reason behind is that it uses HTML5 History API to keep track of the router history of your React app. The `HashRouter` has a use case for legacy browsers where `window.location.hash` is still being used to keep a track of routes in a SPA.

## DIY Exercise 👇

Here is a small task for you. Modify directory structure like below screenshot and separate the two functional components `Home` and `about` in their own component files such that, in future, if they grow with more JSX to render.

![ss5](https://crowdbotics.ghost.io/content/images/2019/05/ss5.png)

You can totally skip this if you want and move on to the next section. But performing this small task will benefit you to have an understanding of the above concepts.

## The Link Component

To navigate between to web pages in HTML, there is an `<a href=""></a>` anchor tag available. However, using this traditional approach will lead to a browser refresh. In order to overcome this, React Router API offers a `Link` component that can be used to navigate to a particular URL or a component.

Let us try to create a navigation menu with this new knowledge. Import Link from `react-router-dom` in `App.js` file. Here is the modified snippet of App component.

```js
// App.js

import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import Home from './components/Home';
import About from './components/About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav style={{ margin: 10 }}>
          <Link to="/" style={{ padding: 10 }}>
            Home
          </Link>

          <Link to="/about" style={{ padding: 10 }}>
            About
          </Link>
        </nav>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the above snippet, notice that all the Links are being added before all the Route components. The styling attributes inside `style` are optional for now. Start the development server and visit the browser window and you will notice a navigation menu pops up at the top. Try clicking links to navigate between different components.

![ss5](https://crowdbotics.ghost.io/content/images/2019/05/ss6-1.gif)

Wherever a `Link` is rendered in a React project, an anchor `<a>` will be rendered in the application’s HTML.

## Active Links with NavLink

In React Router API, `NavLink` is the extended version of the `Link` component. You can say that is a special type of the `Link` that can style itself as to represent the active state when matches the current route.

To demonstrate this, first, let us replace all the `Link` tags with `NavLink` in `App.js` file.

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

import Home from './components/Home';
import About from './components/About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav style={{ margin: 10 }}>
          <NavLink to="/" style={{ padding: 10 }}>
            Home
          </NavLink>

          <NavLink to="/about" style={{ padding: 10 }}>
            About
          </NavLink>
        </nav>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

At this point, each `NavLink` link is going to behave like an ordinary `Link` component which means there is no change so far. To make a link active, add an `activeClassName` prop to that. Such as below.

```js
<NavLink to='/' style={{ padding: 10 }} activeClassName='active'>
```

To set up the corresponding CSS for this to work, open `App.css` file and add the below.

```css
a {
  padding: 10px;
}

a,
a:visited {
  color: blue;
}

a.active {
  color: red;
}
```

Do not forget to import this file inside `App.js`. Also, modify the `about` route to have an `activeClassName`.

```js
import "./App.css"

// ...

return (
  {/* */}
  <nav style={{ margin: 10 }}>
      <NavLink to='/' activeClassName='active'>
          Home
      </NavLink>

      <NavLink to='/about' activeClassName='active'>
          About
      </NavLink>
  </nav>

 {/* */}
)
```

Go back to the browser, open develop tools like below and you will notice, at first, the `Home` route has a class name `active`.

![ss7](https://crowdbotics.ghost.io/content/images/2019/05/ss7.png)

Try navigating to the `About` route and see what happens.

![ss8](https://crowdbotics.ghost.io/content/images/2019/05/ss8.gif)

On navigating to `About` route did you notice that the active class name is also added to the corresponding route? However, the `Home` route still has the active class even though the URL matches the `/about`. Why?

The way `NavLink` works is almost similar to Route component in React Router API. To make sure that only one route has the class active state, try modifying the home route in the navigation menu, as below.

```js
// App.js

<NavLink to="/" exact activeClassName="active">
  Home
</NavLink>
```

You will get the desired output this time.

## Adding Parameters to the Routes

In this section, you will learn how to create and manage dynamic routes based on a query parameter such as `:id`. We start by creating a static array in the `App.js` file that will serve as the mock data.

The idea is to demonstrate a route as `/posts` which displays all the posts that are coming from the array. However, each post in the array will be having an id or a unique identifier. Using that unique identifier, you will be approaching the concept of dynamic content rendering by writing the logic for URLs such as `/posts/:id` where `:id` will be represented by the specific id of a post.

To start, let us add a bunch of mock posts in the state inside a new component file called `components/posts.js`.

```js
// Posts.js
import React from 'react';
import '../App.css';

class Posts extends React.Component {
  state = {
    posts: [
      { id: 1, title: 'Hello Blog World!' },
      { id: 2, title: 'My second post' },
      { id: 3, title: 'What is React Router?' }
    ]
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="posts">
        <h1>Posts List</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Posts;
```

The corresponding styles to the above are added in `App.css` file for brevity.

```css
.posts ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 0;
}

.posts ul li {
  padding: 10px;
}

.posts a {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

Now, import the newly created component inside `App.js` where other routes already exist.

```js
//App.js
// ...
import Posts from './components/Posts';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav style={{ margin: 10 }}>
          <NavLink to="/" exact activeClassName="active">
            Home
          </NavLink>
          <NavLink to="/about" activeClassName="active">
            About
          </NavLink>
          <NavLink to="/posts" activeClassName="active">
            Posts
          </NavLink>
        </nav>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/posts" component={Posts} />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The existing navigation menu has a new route and its called Posts.

![ss10](https://crowdbotics.ghost.io/content/images/2019/05/ss10.png)

Open `Posts.js` to render the list of Posts and display them as a list whenever the current location in the web browser matches `/posts`.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Link, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import '../App.css';

function Child({ match }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>ID: {match.params.id}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}

class Posts extends React.Component {
  state = {
    posts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Hello Blog World!'
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'My second post'
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        title: 'What is React Router?'
      }
    ]
  };

  render() {
    const { posts } = this.state;
    return (
      <div className="posts">
        <h1>Posts List</h1>
        <ul>
          {posts.map(post => (
            <li key={post.id}>
              <Link to={`/posts/${post.id}`}>{post.title}</Link>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <Route path="/posts/:id" component={Child} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Posts;
```

Also, the `Child` component reads anything coming from the URL parameters, such as, in the above case, the `id` of each post. A `match` object contains information about how a `<Route path>` matched the URL, thus, in our case, the id of each post.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, by now, you are familiar with the basic concepts of how React Router library works. It is a powerful library that helps you build better React apps. If you want to learn more about React Router visit its official documentation [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/).
