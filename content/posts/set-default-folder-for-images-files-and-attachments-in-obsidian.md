I've used Obsidian as my primary note-taking app for over six months. One thing I've found myself often doing (either work or personal) is using screenshots as images in my notes.

Now, if you have used Obsidian or started using it, all images or attachments are stored in the root vault folder. If you are fine with it, you can skip reading this article and spend your time on something more useful. However, if you are like me, and want to stick to using a note-taking app and keep things organized, then keep reading.
I organize my notes into two top-level folders:

I organize my notes into two top level folders:

- `Areas`: Notes on stuff related to my personal life, books I read, and things I'm learning.
- `Inbox`: Notes on work, meetings, people, and the articles I'm working on.

I wanted a separate folder for images and attachments that could serve both folders and keep things organized in the vault. In Obsidian, it's doable by changing one setting:

- Click **Settings** in the Obsidian desktop app and in the Settings menu, click **Files & Links**.
- In the **Default location for new attachments**, in the dropdown, select **In the folder specified below**.
- In the **Attachment folder path**, choose the path of the folder you want to save all images and other files.
