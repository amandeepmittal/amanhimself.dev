_Last Update: July 6, 2024_

I’m Aman Mittal, a documentarian and developer. I love to explore and write about different technologies. My journey in the tech world started as a consultant and a Developer Advocate and has evolved through various roles in content development and technical writing.

When I'm not immersed in code or crafting documentation, you’ll find me either [reading a book](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17657541.Aman_Mittal) or exploring new places.
