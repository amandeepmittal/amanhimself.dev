## What I am doing now?

- Working on [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev) as an independent contractor.
- Focused on docs-as-code workflows and developer education.
- Thinking more deliberately about the craft of technical writing. What makes documentation genuinely useful, how docs-as-code workflows should work, and how AI is changing the way we write and maintain docs.
- 📚 Reading: Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17657541.Aman_Mittal)

## What I care about

Developer documentation that respects the reader. API references that are accurate and navigable. SDK guides that meet developers where they are. Docs-as-code pipelines that make content maintainable. I believe documentation is product work, not an afterthought.

## What I am using?

- 💻 16-inch MacBook Pro (2023) with M3 chip. This is on-the-go machine.
- ⌨️ Keychron K3 Pro with Gateron Brown switches.
- 🎮 Nintendo Switch for Breath of the Wild and a Steam Deck.
- 📖 I use a Kobo Libra Color for most of my non-fiction reading. It's also been used for fiction but I try to use mobile device with Kindle app for that.

## What is this page, anyways?

According to [aboutideasnow](https://aboutideasnow.com/about), an "/about" page is to talk about past stuff including what you have done in your past life. In comparison, a "/now" page is more personal look at what a person is doing right now, and what they care about. A "/now" page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

You can find plethora of examples on [aboutideasnow](https://aboutideasnow.com/about) and [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/).
