## What I am doing now?

_Location: New Delhi, India_

- I'm currently work as a documentation person at Expo. Some call me docs steward and some call me docs lead. I think my work mostly resolves around managing the content side of [docs.expo.dev](https://docs.expo.dev) as well contribute to it, among other hats I wear at my day job.
- My interest in technology currently includes Information Architecture around technical documentation, and Expo and React Native for creating mobile apps.
- 🕹️ Playing: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Disco Elysium
- 📚 Reading: Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17657541.Aman_Mittal)
- Trying to write everyday in my free time so this blog doesn't get trivialize.

## What is this page, anyways?

According to [aboutideasnow](https://aboutideasnow.com/about), an "/about" page is to talk about past stuff including what you have done in your past life. In comparison, a "/now" page is more personal look at what a person is doing right now, and what they care about. A "/now" page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

You can find plethora of examples on [aboutideasnow](https://aboutideasnow.com/about) and [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/).
