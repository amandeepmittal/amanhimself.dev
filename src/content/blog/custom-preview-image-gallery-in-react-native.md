In React Native, there are many ways to display a collection of images in a gallery view. One form is commonly known as carousel. Using an open-source library such as [react-native-swiper](https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper) or more advance [react-native-snap-carousel](https://github.com/meliorence/react-native-snap-carousel) serves the purpose. But what if we want to create a custom gallery view with additional functionality?

In this tutorial, let's create a custom gallery of images using `react-native-snap-carousel` and `FlatList` from React Native. The open-source library is going to display each image in a carousel view. The `FlatList` is what we will use to display the thumbnail view for each image below the carousel. The construction of the syncing part between the two is to add a functionality such that when an image in the carousel is scrolled either left or right, the thumb in the `FlatList` is also going to be scrolled along with it. Of course, to achieve this synchronization between the two, we are going to use React Hooks such that you will be able to implement such a pattern in your own React Native apps.

## Pre-requisites

To follow this tutorial, please make sure you are familiarized with JavaScript/ES6 and meet the following requirements in your local dev environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >= 12.x.x installed.
- Have access to one package manager such as npm or yarn or npx.
- [react-native-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli) installed, or use npx.

## Setup a React Native Project

To follow along with this tutorial, set up a new React Native project and install all the dependencies that are required to implement the example. Open up a terminal window and run each command as mentioned in the order:

```shell
npx react-native init rnPreviewImageGallery

cd rnPreviewImageGallery

yarn add react-native-snap-carousel
```

The reason I like to use `react-native-snap-carousel` is that it does not require any additional steps to configure to be used on native devices. Plus, it offers different layouts to configure the carousel view, out of the box.

After installing the dependencies, let's bring in the image assets to use. I am using images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/amsterdam) to demonstrate. To follow along, the images are stored at [this location](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/react-native-examples/tree/master/rnPreviewImageGallery/assets/images) in the example GitHub repo.

After setting up the source images to be used, open up the `App.js` file, and let's initiate it with a title of the screen to display. Import the following statements, then create an `IMAGES` object by importing each image using Common JS require statements.

Using the `useState` React hook, create an array of images called `images`, with each image having a unique `id` to differentiate between each object in the array.

```js
const [images, setImages] = useState([]);
```

The `useState` hook returns two values in an array. The first value is the current value of the state object, and the second value in the array is the function to update the state value of the first. This why the second value starts with a conventional prefix of a set. You can technically name it anything, but following conventions that are commonly used in the React world is a good practice to follow.

Also, define some constants that will be used throughout the example such as the overall spacing between each thumbnail and the width and height of each thumbnail to represent in the `FlatList`.

To set up the carousel view of an image for different screen sizes, let's use the `Dimensions` API from React Native.

Add the following code snippet to `App.js` and make sure to define state variables at the top of the `App` function. Hooks are always called at the top level of a functional component in React. When defining a state, they must be the first thing in the function, especially before returning a JSX.

```js
import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import {
  TouchableOpacity,
  View,
  Text,
  Image,
  FlatList,
  Dimensions
} from 'react-native';

const { width } = Dimensions.get('window');
const SPACING = 10;
const THUMB_SIZE = 80;

const IMAGES = {
  image1: require('./assets/images/1.jpeg'),
  image2: require('./assets/images/2.jpeg'),
  image3: require('./assets/images/3.jpeg'),
  image4: require('./assets/images/4.jpeg'),
  image5: require('./assets/images/5.jpeg'),
  image6: require('./assets/images/6.jpeg'),
  image7: require('./assets/images/7.jpeg')
};

const App = () => {
  const [images, setImages] = useState([
    { id: '1', image: IMAGES.image1 },
    { id: '2', image: IMAGES.image2 },
    { id: '3', image: IMAGES.image3 },
    { id: '4', image: IMAGES.image4 },
    { id: '5', image: IMAGES.image5 },
    { id: '6', image: IMAGES.image6 },
    { id: '7', image: IMAGES.image7 }
  ]);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text
        style={{
          color: 'white',
          fontSize: 32,
          marginTop: 50,
          marginBottom: 25
        }}
      >
        Custom Gallery
      </Text>
      {/* Carousel View */}
      {/* Thumbnail component using FlatList */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

To initialize the development server for iOS, please execute the command `npx react-native run-ios` from a terminal window. Similarly, the build command for Android is `npx react-native run-android`.

Here is the app running after this step on an iOS simulator:

## Add a carousel view with react-native-snap-carousel

The component library `react-native-snap-carousel` has a vast API of properties and different layout patterns that are plug-n-use and even allows you as a developer to implement custom interpolations and animations. You can find more information on how to customize it in the official documentation [here](https://github.com/meliorence/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/CUSTOM_INTERPOLATIONS.md).

For the current example, let's stick to the default layout pattern to display a carousel. To create a carousel view, import the component from `react-native-snap-carousel` by adding the following import statement in the `App.js` file. Let's also import the `Pagination` component offered separately by this library to display the dot indicator.

```js
// after other import statements
import Carousel, { Pagination } from 'react-native-snap-carousel';
```

Then, add a `View` component after the title in the `App.js` file. It is going to wrap the `Carousel` component which takes a set of required props to work:

- `data` the array of `images` or items to loop.
- `layout` to define the way images are rendered and animated. We will use the `default` value.
- `sliderWidth` to define the width in pixels for the carousel container.
- `itemWidth` to define the width in pixels for each item rendered inside the carousel.
- `renderItem` takes an image item from the `data` array and renders it as a list. To render the image, the `Image` component from React Native is used.

Add the following code snippet in `App.js` to see the carousel in action:

```js
return (
  <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    {/* Title JSX Remains same */}
    {/* Carousel View */}
    <View style={{ flex: 1 / 2, marginTop: 20 }}>
      <Carousel
        layout="default"
        data={images}
        sliderWidth={width}
        itemWidth={width}
        renderItem={({ item, index }) => (
          <Image
            key={index}
            style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
            resizeMode="contain"
            source={item.image}
          />
        )}
      />
    </View>
  </View>
);
```

In the simulator you are going to get the following result:

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/536/0*9-RZy5PEztyt-lEF.gif' />

## Add a dot indicator

The `Pagination` component from the `react-native-snap-carousel` is used to display a dot indicator. This dot indicator requires the following props:

- `activeDotIndex` to represent the current image shown in the carousel.
- `dotsLength` to calculate how many dots to display based on the number of items or images in the carousel.
- `inactiveDotColor` to display the dot indicator color when it is inactive.
- `dotColor` to display the dot indicator color when it is active.
- `inactiveDotScale` is used to set the value to scale the dot indicator when it's inactive.
- `animatedDuration` is used to control the length of dot animation in milliseconds. The default value for it is `250`. It is not required, but to change the value, use this prop.

Add the following code snippet after the `Carousel` component in `App.js` file:

```js
<View>
  {/* Carousel Component code remains same */}
  <Pagination
    inactiveDotColor="gray"
    dotColor={'orange'}
    activeDotIndex={indexSelected}
    dotsLength={images.length}
    animatedDuration={150}
    inactiveDotScale={1}
  />
</View>
```

The value of `activeDotIndex` is calculated based on the current index of the image item. Let's add a state variable called `indexSelected` in the `App` component with a value of zero. It is going to update when the index value of the current image changes. The initial value of this state variable is going to be `0`. Create a handler method called `onSelect()` which updates the value of the current index.

Add the following code snippet before rendering the JSX in `App` component:

```js
const App = () => {
  // code remains same
  const [indexSelected, setIndexSelected] = useState(0);

  const onSelect = indexSelected => {
    setIndexSelected(indexSelected);
  };
};
```

Now, add a prop to the `Carousel` component called `onSnapToItem`. It accepts a callback as a value. This callback is fired every time the index of the image item changes, in other words, every time the user swipes to the next image. The only argument passed to this callback is the current `index` of the item which is updated with the help of the `onSelect()` handler method.

```js
<Carousel
  // rest remains same
  onSnapToItem={index => onSelect(index)}
/>
```

In the simulator, you will get the following result. The dot indicator now syncs with the Carousel item.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/588/0*hE8I2aJxoFp5UnDu.gif' />

Let's add another view component below the `View` that wraps the carousel to display the total number of images and the current image index number.

```js
// Carousel View
<View
  style={{
    marginTop: 20,
    paddingHorizontal: 32,
    alignSelf: 'flex-end'
  }}
>
  <Text
    style={{
      color: 'white',
      fontSize: 22
    }}
  >
    {indexSelected + 1}/{images.length}
  </Text>
</View>
```

Here is the result after this step:

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*9h1KAqUOt9LzOORL.png' />

Awesome! The configuration for the Carousel component is now complete. Let's see how to sync it with a custom FlatList component in the next section.

## Create a list of thumbnails using FlatList

Let's display a list of thumbnails using `FlatList` from React Native using the same array of `images` from the state variable. This list is going to be displayed at the bottom of the device's screen and is a horizontal list. To achieve that, let's set use `position: absolute` style property with a `bottom` of value `80`.

Each thumbnail is composed of an `Image` component. It has the width and the height of the `THUMB_SIZE` variable we declared earlier. To show the selected thumbnail or the current thumbnail, using a ternary operator, let's manipulate the style properties `borderWidth` and `borderColor` on this `Image` component.

It is going to be wrapped by a `TouchableOpacity` component because its `onPress` prop is going to fire a handler method we have yet to create, to allow a user to change the selected image by a tap.

Add the following code snippet after Carousel's View:

```js
<FlatList
  horizontal={true}
  data={images}
  style={{ position: 'absolute', bottom: 80 }}
  showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
  contentContainerStyle={{
    paddingHorizontal: SPACING
  }}
  keyExtractor={item => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item, index }) => (
    <TouchableOpacity activeOpacity={0.9}>
      <Image
        style={{
          width: THUMB_SIZE,
          height: THUMB_SIZE,
          marginRight: SPACING,
          borderRadius: 16,
          borderWidth: index === indexSelected ? 4 : 0.75,
          borderColor: index === indexSelected ? 'orange' : 'white'
        }}
        source={item.image}
      />
    </TouchableOpacity>
  )}
/>
```

The list of thumbnails renders as shown below:

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*JyzPZ5toA-v8mg3k.png' />

In the previous image, you will see that the first image is selected. You cannot change the currently selected image yet in the FlatList.

## Syncing the Carousel view with the FlatList

The basic element that is going to allow us to sync the image change between both the Carousel view and the thumbnail is a React hook called `useRef`.

It is a function that returns a mutable ref object whose `current` property can be initialized to keep track of the current index value for each image. The index value here is the image selected. Initially, it is going to be the first thumbnail and the first image shown in the carousel.

Let's create a ref that is going to be the reference of the current image from `Carousel` component and add it to the `App.js` file:

```js
const App = () => {
  const carouselRef = useRef();
  // ...
};
```

Since the `Carousel` component keeps track of the change of the current index of the image component by triggering a callback called `snapToItem()`, we can use it to sync with the `FlatList`.

Start by adding a handler method called `onTouchThumbnail()` after defining the ref. It accepts one argument called `touched` which is the index value of the current image selected from the `TouchableOpacity` component or Carousel. If the value of the argument `touched` and `indexSelected` is the same, do nothing. Otherwise, when the value of the `touched` or `indexSelected` updates, change the current image in the `Carousel` and the `FlatList` at the same time.

```js
const onTouchThumbnail = touched => {
  if (touched === indexSelected) return;

  carouselRef?.current?.snapToItem(touched);
};
```

Add the `ref` prop on `Carousel` component:

```js
<Carousel
  ref={carouselRef}
  //...
/>
```

Next, add an `onPress` prop on the `TouchableOpacity` component:

```js
<TouchableOpacity
  onPress={() => onTouchThumbnail(index)}
  activeOpacity={0.9}
>
```

Here is the output after this step:

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/582/0*TdtJeFSTFtRUV5L_.gif' />

The selection sync works do you notice there is a problem with the `FlatList` component? It doesn't scroll on its own when an image from the Carousel is selected that is not in the current view on the screen.

## Scroll the FlatList using scrollToOffset

Start by creating a new ref called `flatListRef` in `App.js` and add the ref prop to `FlatList` component:

```js
const App = () => {
  // ...
  const flatListRef = useRef();

  return (
    // ...
    <FlatList
      ref={flatListRef}
      // rest remains same
    />
  );
};
```

The [scrollToOffset method](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#scrolltooffset) available on `FlatList` can be used to scroll the thumbnails to a certain offset. This method accepts two arguments. The first is called `offset` which accepts a number as a value. The second argument is the `animated` property which determines whether the scroll to even should be animated or not.

The value for the `offset` is going to be `indexSelected` of the thumbnail multiplied by the size of the thumbnail. Let's also set the value of `animated` to true.

Since the `FlatList` has to scroll on every selection, let's add mutate the ref inside the handler method `onSelect()`.

```js
const onSelect = indexSelected => {
  setIndexSelected(indexSelected);

  flatListRef?.current?.scrollToOffset({
    offset: indexSelected * THUMB_SIZE,
    animated: true
  });
};
```

Here is the output after this step:

## Conclusion

We have discussed only one scenario of creating a custom image gallery with FlatList. The main objective here is to get familiar with the use of react-native-snap-carousel, useRef hook, and `scrollToOffset` method in FlatList.
