- My mental health has not been the best this week. It's been difficult to focus to watch/read/listen due to lack of sleep.
- Made more progress to completing the llms.txt project at work. Ended up writing custom scripts to generate data in markdown from local files instead of using an external tool to scrape data from the document site.
- Played around with PiCO-8 for a while over the weekend. It was nice and fun. I like how restrictive it is.
- Did some style changes to the blog by fixing some issues with both dark and light themes that are used on this blog. In the end, I decided to change the color scheme for both themes because I felt the code blocks for both themes didn't match the dark theme at all and were too light for the light theme.

## Writing

- One new draft this week.

## Reading

- Finished reading Masters of Doom by David Kushner. While it was nostalgic since I remember playing Wolfenstein 3D as one of the first games on a PC, the book wasn't that impressive. It jumped a lot between different timelines in a short number of pages.
