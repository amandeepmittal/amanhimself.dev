To create or setup a new React app, I try to use `npx` from a terminal window. By executing the following command, it generates a new React app using the `create-react-app` utility.

```shell
npx create-react-app reactapp

# after the project has generated

cd reactapp
```

The name of the project `reactapp` mentioned in the command is the project name. To start this newly created React app, run the below command from the terminal window:

```shell
yarn start
```

It will trigger the default React app that is generated by `create-react-app` command-line utility and open the app in a browser window at URL `http://localhost:3000`.

Now, setup the project as per the need. The following directory basic setup is how I like to setup a new React app (_when using Firebase as the backend service_).

Add an initial modification of `src/App.js` file to the file code snippet.

```js
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React App</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This modification is going to lead to the following change in a web browser window.

## Create Firebase project-based components

The basic directory structure is all setup, now let's create the Firebase project-related component folders. Each component folder inside `src/components/` is going to have an `index.js` file that is going to contain the code snippet related to that particular component.

For example, in a Firebase + React app, the sign in, sign out and sign up component is going to be three different components to handle user authentication. Thus, all are going to have separate folders. To create a component folder you can use the command-line interface or the editor or the IDE file explorer.

```shell
cd components/

mkdir SignIn SignOut SignUp
```

The `./src/Pages` directory is optional. I like to separate presentation page components such as `Home` or `Landing` in a different folder but that depends on the project itself.

The initial components directory is done. In the next section, let us get the API keys from the Firebase project.

## Generate Firebase API keys

<blockquote display="info">
  Before you generate API keys for Firebase configuration in a React app, please
  make sure you have either set up a new Firebase app or have access to a
  Firebase app using its console.
</blockquote>

If you are new to Firebase apps, please refer to the post here that explains üëâ [how to create a new Firebase project?](https://amanhimself.dev/new-firebase-project/)

Once you have created or opened a Firebase project, from the dashboard screen, click on the _settings_ icon ‚öôÔ∏è from the side menu.

![ss12](https://i.imgur.com/zkv9SNA.png)

The _Settings_ page opens as shown below.

![ss13](https://i.imgur.com/ZTgOnQk.png)

To create a new app, go to the section that says `Your apps` and click on the third icon or the Web icon. The first two icons shown are for creating keys for native platforms such as iOS and Android.

![ss16](https://i.imgur.com/FGaubt7.png)

Next, there is going to be a prompt about adding the name of the web app. Enter a name.

![ss14](https://i.imgur.com/m2mhbm6.png)

Then the API keys required by the web app are generated as shown below. The blacked-out part is the actual key values and I recommend not sharing with anyone.

![ss15](https://i.imgur.com/NGYOauf.png)

Make sure you save the `firebaseConfig` object. It is the object the contains all the API keys required to use various Firebase services such as authentication, database and so on.

Once you copied the `firebaseConfig` object, you press the button that says `Continue to console`. You are going to be taken back to the `Settings` page.

## Environment variables in a React app

Create a new file inside the React project called `.env`. Make sure to add this file to `.gitignore` and do not commit it to the [GitHub](https://github.com) repo or any other public repository on a version control platform.

This file is going to save all the Firebase API keys as shown below. All the `xxxx`'s represent the keys generated in the Firebase console. Replace them with your own keys.

```shell
DEV_API_KEY=xxxx

DEV_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxx

DEV_DATABASE_URL=xxxx

DEV_PROJECT_ID=xxxx

DEV_STORAGE_BUCKET=xxxx

DEV_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xxxx

DEV_APP_ID=xxxx

DEV_MEASUREMENT_ID=xxxx
```

<blockquote display="info">
  You do not have to name each key with the prefix `DEV_`. You can either use
  their default name such as `API_KEY` or follow your own convention. I like to
  follow `DEV_` and `PROD_` prefixes to separate dev mode and production mode
  Firebase projects.
</blockquote>

## Connect Firebase with a React app

React app needs Firebase SDK installed as an npm dependency. Open terminal window, execute the following command to install the dependency.

```shell
yarn add firebase
```

For Firebase SDK to initialize with the React app and use the Firebase services further in the app, it needs to consume the API keys generated in the previous section as a configuration object. This object is a plain JavaScript object with key and value
pairs.

Create a new file `src/Firebase/firebase.js` import the `firebase` library and create a `firebaseConfig` object with appropriate keys and their values saved in `.env` file.

```js
// firebase.js

import * as firebase from 'firebase/app';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.DEV_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.DEV_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.DEV_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.DEV_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.DEV_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.DEV_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.DEV_APP_ID,
  measurementId: process.env.DEV_MEASUREMENT_ID
};
```

The `firebase/app` import statement is always required when you add the Firebase SDK to a new Web app or React project. It should also be the import statement line in this file.

The current format of `firebaseConfig` object shows that all the Firebase services from its console are enabled.

<blockquote display="default">
  Side-note: To use a different set of API keys or Firebase projects such as for
  development and production, you can create two `config` objects here. For dev
  mode, create `devConfig` and for production, create `prodConfig`.
</blockquote>

```js
const prodConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.PROD_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.PROD_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.PROD_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.PROD_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.PROD_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.PROD_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.PROD_APP_ID,
  measurementId: process.env.PROD_MEASUREMENT_ID
};

const devConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.DEV_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.DEV_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.DEV_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.DEV_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.DEV_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.DEV_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.DEV_APP_ID,
  measurementId: process.env.DEV_MEASUREMENT_ID
};
```

Then using JavaScript conditional operator, you can condition between the two.

```js
const config = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? prodConfig : devConfig;
```

This way, you will prevent the mixing of data and other information between development mode app and production or deployed app.

## Initializing the Firebase SDK

Initializing the Firebase SDK with the current React app is the first step. To do this, you have to use a method called `initializeApp()` and pass the `firebaseConfig` as the only argument to this method after defining the config object.

```js
// firebase.js

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

Lastly, to test that the Firebase SDK is working with the React app, let us export the `firebase` instance from `Firebase/firebase.js` file.

```js
export default firebase;
```

Open `App.js` file, import the `firebase` instance, and using `useEffect` hook let us try to see if it's initialized or not.

```js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

// TODO: REMOVE THIS IMPORT STATEMENT BELOW BEFORE PROCEEDING

import firebase from './Firebase/firebase';

function App() {
  // TODO: REMOVE THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(firebase);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React App</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

To see the output of the console statement from the above code snippet, open Developer Tools -> Console tab in the web browser. On the initial render of `App` component or the React app, the `useEffect` hook is going to trigger.

The object returned from Firebase clearly states that there are no errors with the current Firebase config in a React app.

It is important to notice that Firebase should only be initialized once in the React app. This pattern is called [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern). This initialization should be the top level component in the React components tree.

## Conclusion

- Generate Firebase API keys for configuration
- Used environment variables inside a React app to manage keys
- Install `firebase` SDK npm package
- Connect Firebase SDK to React app
- Initialize the Firebase SDK
- Why initialize a Firebase instance only once per React app?
