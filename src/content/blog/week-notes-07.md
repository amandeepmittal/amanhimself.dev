Not a good week for my mental health. Most of the week was spent overthinking, migraine, more overthinking, and more pain.

- The weather is changing and becoming warmer, so it might help in the coming weeks.
- Work week was busy.
- Workout-wise, it was a good week. I managed to do complete routines and brisk walking for the majority of the week.
- Started playing Shovel Knight: Shover of Hope and mind blown that there's no save the progress feature available. I guess that's retro platformer behavior they tried to implement in this game, but I really miss it.

## Writing

- Published a [new blog post](/blog/using-at-method-from-javascript/).

## Reading

- Completed volume 6 of the Bakuman.
- Completed How to Calm Your Mind by Chris Bailey. I can confirm I am not a fan this book.
