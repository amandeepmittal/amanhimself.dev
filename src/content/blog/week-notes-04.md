Second full week back to work this year.

- I was able to get a workout for half of this week. It includes mostly weight but a little bit of cardio.
- I did some self-reflection. There are a lot of things I'd like to work on about myself and my mental health.
- Played Celeste completed the majority of the gameplay. Such a beautiful game. Not only was the narrative to the mark, but the play was also interesting. Even though I died a lot and took the help of assist mode (well thought out by developers), it was a nice 3 hours spent.
- The Celeste classic version was created in Pico-8, which is amazing! I only learned about Pico-8 last week and its usage. Fascinating!
- I do not pay much attention to soundtrack while playing games but this game has a really immersive one.

## Writing

- Wrote one new blog post draft this week.

## Reading

- Started The Dance of Fear by Harriet Lerner.
- Took a little break from the reading this week. I didn't complete the book I started, and yet it feels nice to take a break.
