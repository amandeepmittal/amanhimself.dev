As 2024 comes to an end, I am starting to write Week Notes. Since this is my first one, I'll keep this recap a short one mainly because these notes are only for me. Also, this week has not been a busy one. With winter and gloomy cold weather due to recent rain, I don't have much to add.

- Rainy end of the week. Mostly, I stayed inside. On days on which the sun was shining brightly, I traveled within the city.
- Headaches are back. I am not sure about the root cause yet; if I am tired or caused by lack of sleep.
- Christmas came and went. I tried to watch a Christmas movie but was unable to pick (decision fatigue), so I decided to start reading Breakfast with Seneca by David Fideler.
- Cleaned up some recurring tasks in Things 3 as they are no longer required. Every morning I wake up and open the laptop, my brain does the job now of reminding them.
- Spent a couple of days working on the dogfooding project using Expo and RAWG API. Tried Expo's new public environment variables for the first time. I am feeling pretty good about the progress I have made so far, which includes using the local development setup environment and using my iPhone to test the app with the iPhone mirroring feature of Sequoia. Spent some time polishing the app's UI. So far, it uses Expo Router for navigation, displays a home screen to display an infinite list of games (using React Query's infinite query hook), Expo Dev tools plugin for React Query, and a second stacked screen to view the details for a particular game item. Created a dynamic modal screen that uses form-sheet presentation for iOS.
- I made naan bread again (after the breadpalooza activity at Expo earlier this month), and this time, they were stuffed.

## Writing

- Wrote 4 complete drafts for upcoming blog posts. I planned out a few more that I hope to complete in the coming weeks. The big one is the yearly review.
- Updated My Macbook setup post's description and VS Code extensions list
- Wrote one unfinished blog post based on the recent dogfooding Expo app

## Reading

- Finished book 54: Breakfast with Seneca by David Fideler. Started reading it on Christmas day. I liked how they focused on twelve to thirteen Seneca's letters for the book's core. It has some references from Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, but you cannot go without it when reading or writing a book, Stoicism.
- Finished book 55: The Art of Note-taking by Thinknetic. It was okay. The five note-taking strategies discussed in the book, the sentence-based note-taking technique, stood out. I learned about myself that I already do that sometimes (especially during meetings) with a list/outline structure that I follow.
