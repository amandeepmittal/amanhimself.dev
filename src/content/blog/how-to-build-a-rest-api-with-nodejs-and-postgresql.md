One of the most important aspects of being a Web Developer is to know how to work with APIs.

Whether building your own application as a front-end or back-end engineer, you are going to come across them. APIs are the core communication system behind the different software systems including the server, the database and the client-side of an application.

In this tutorial, **we are going to create a REST API using** [**Node.js**](https://www.crowdbotics.com/build/node-js/?utm_campaign=v1&utm_source=blog-post&utm_medium=Medium&utm_content=node) **as the back-end server with help from ExpressJS framework, and connect it with** [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) **database.**

## Prerequisites

To get started with this tutorial, knowledge of the following will be beneficial.

- Knowledge of some of the ES6 JavaScript features
- Node.js and npm installed on your local dev machine
- PostgreSQL installed

If you do not have PostgreSQL installed on your local development machine, you can continue reading the next step where I will walk you through step by step installing it. If you already have it, please skip the next step.

## Installing PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful and an open source object-relational database. If you are on a Windows machine, PostgreSQL offers an [**installer**](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)**.**

On macOS, I am going to use `Homebrew` to install it. Open a terminal window and type the following command.

```shell
brew install postgresql
```

Once the installation is complete, to start the PostgreSQL database you will need to run the below command.

```shell
brew services start postgresql
```

After starting this service, you will get a success message like below.

**Note**: Later on, when you need to stop the `postresql` service, you can run the command `brew services stop postgresql`.

## Getting Started

Create an empty directory and run the following set of commands to initialize an Express server.

```shell
# create a new directory
mkdir rest-api-nodejs-postgresql

# traverse inside it
cd rest-api-nodejs-postgresql

# initialize npm
npm int --yes

# install express
npm install -S express
```

Create a `server.js` file which is going to be the entry point for our server. At the top, we are going to require the `express` module and add some configuration middleware functions to handle `req.body` data. To run the server, type the command `node index.js` and go to URL `http://localhost:4000/` in a browser window and you will get the following result.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hkctm5kI-r_XA_Ksg6fQAw.png' />

With that working, we need a way to restart the server every time we change something in our code. I am going to use `nodemon` which will automatically watch for changes in any `.js` file we make in our demo app. To install run `npm i -D nodemon` and add the following to your `package.json` file.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

To now run the project we need to use `npm run start` command from now on.

## Setting up Sequelize

Since you have installed PostgreSQL database, and the service is up and running, we can move on to the next step that is to make a connection between the ExpressJS server and PostgreSQL. In order to do that, you will need an ORM (_Object Relational Mapper_) to provide us an interface for both the connection and the API. For our demo, we are going to use [**Sequelize**](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/). Let us begin by installing it.

```shell
npm install -S sequelize-cli
```

The next step is to create a `.sequelizerc` file in the root of our project. This is going to be the configuration file that contains the specific paths required by Sequelize module. It will help us generate folders and files necessary for sequelize to work.

```js
path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  config: path.resolve('./config', 'config.json'),
  'models-path': path.resolve('./models'),
  'seeders-path': path.resolve('./seeders'),
  'migration-path': path.resolve('./migrations')
};
```

Notice that we are making use of `path` module from Node's core API in this process. The `path.resolve()` method resolves a sequence of paths or path segments into an absolute path. If no path segments are passed, path.resolve() will return the absolute path of the current working directory and in our case, the current working directory is going to be the root of our project.

Now, let’s run the initializing command in order to generate the boilerplate code and necessary folders.

```shell
sequelize init
```

When you run the above command successfully, you will get the following result.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Nx7Ck_TlesGm552IzEVF5Q.png' />

You will also find changes made to your project directory like below. New files and folders created from the `.sequelizerc` file.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OiyN1jTzSb9wPQed6YHd6w.png' />

## Making Database Connection

The next step is to install the required dependencies in order to create a database connection with a PostgreSQL database and have access to the database for CRUD operations. Fire up your terminal with the following command.

```shell
npm install -S pg pg-hstore
```

The package `pg` is responsible for creating the database connection with our Express server and `pg-hstore` is for serializing and deserializing JSON data into the PostgreSQL's hstore format. `hstore` data format stores information in key/value pairs within a single PostgreSQL value. To read more about what exactly `hstore` is or how it works, you can pause here and give the [**official documentation**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/hstore.html) a glimpse.

The two files that are being used in order to create the database connection in our project are `config/config.js` and `models/index.js`. The first thing you need to do here is to create a local database instance. From the command line run the below command.

```shell
createdb todos
```

The above `createdb` command is made available to us when we install the PostgreSQL database. Now, let us make some modifications to the`config.js` file. We have to manually define the database instance we create. You can even set up the password to protect the database on your local machine. For our demo, I am going to leave this configuration field to `null`. Also, you will have to change the database dialect to `postgres`.

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "todos",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "todos",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "todos",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  }
}
```

You can change the aforementioned values for all three: `development`, `test`, and `production` but do make a notice, for now, we are going to use `development`. This is done in `models/index.js`.

```js
'use strict';

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
const basename = path.basename(__filename);
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
const config = require(__dirname + '/../config/config.json')[env];
const db = {};

let sequelize;
if (config.use_env_variable) {
  sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env[config.use_env_variable], config);
} else {
  sequelize = new Sequelize(
    config.database,
    config.username,
    config.password,
    config
  );
}

fs.readdirSync(__dirname)
  .filter(file => {
    return (
      file.indexOf('.') !== 0 && file !== basename && file.slice(-3) === '.js'
    );
  })
  .forEach(file => {
    const model = sequelize['import'](path.join(__dirname, file));
    db[model.name] = model;
  });

Object.keys(db).forEach(modelName => {
  if (db[modelName].associate) {
    db[modelName].associate(db);
  }
});

db.sequelize = sequelize;
db.Sequelize = Sequelize;

module.exports = db;
```

When you deploy your application and use an online hosted database instance, you will need to change `const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';` with the database URL you get. With this, our setup is complete.

## Creating the Database Model

In this section, you are going to create two models: `Todo` and `TodoItem`. The `Todo` is going to be the list of one or many `TodoItem`. In terms of traditional SQL database, you can say that `Todo` will have a relationship with `TodoItem` of one-to-many. We are going to sequelize command line interface to generate the boilerplate code for our models.

```shell
sequelize model:create --name Todo --attributes title:string
```

The above command will generate a new file inside `models/todo.js`. You can verify that the above command runs successfully with below image.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Du48q0ycr2EH7UTMQnkjBA.png' />

As you can see, another file is created in `migrations/` directory. Our concern at this time is the model file itself which looks like this.

```js
'use strict';
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const Todo = sequelize.define(
    'Todo',
    {
      title: DataTypes.STRING
    },
    {}
  );
  Todo.associate = function (models) {
    // associations can be defined here
  };
  return Todo;
};
```

This file is exporting a model called `Todo` which has a single attribute `title` as type `string`. Let us now create our next model for `TodoItem`.

```shell
sequelize model:create --name TodoItem --attributes content:string,complete:boolean
```

This is how our second model inside `todoitem.js` looks like. It has two attributes, `content` of datatype `string` and complete of datatype `boolean`.

```js
'use strict';
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const TodoItem = sequelize.define(
    'TodoItem',
    {
      content: DataTypes.STRING,
      complete: DataTypes.BOOLEAN
    },
    {}
  );
  TodoItem.associate = function (models) {
    // associations can be defined here
  };
  return TodoItem;
};
```

## Creating the Database Relationship

`Todo` and `TodoItem` are going to have one-to-many-relationship. This done by associating both the models and define a custom class method. Let us modify both the model files to add this and some modification in each attribute for things to work our way. Open `todo.js` file.

```js
'use strict';
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const Todo = sequelize.define(
    'Todo',
    {
      title: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING
      }
    },
    {}
  );
  Todo.associate = function (models) {
    // associations can be defined here
    Todo.hasMany(models.TodoItem, {
      foreignKey: 'todoId',
      as: 'todoItems'
    });
  };
  return Todo;
};
```

The first modification you will make is to add `type` to make the attribute easier to read. Next, inside `Todo.associate` class method we are defining a relationship between both our models using `hasMany` method. Notice how it intakes `models` parameter. The `foreignKey,` in this case, the `id` of each `TodoItem`. The `as` attribute next to `foreignKey` means that on each query for a todo, it will include the todo items for the above id.

Now, open `todoitem.js`.

```js
'use strict';
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const TodoItem = sequelize.define(
    'TodoItem',
    {
      content: { type: DataTypes.STRING },
      complete: { type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN, defaultValue: false }
    },
    {}
  );
  TodoItem.associate = function (models) {
    // associations can be defined here

    TodoItem.belongsTo(models.Todo, {
      foreignKey: 'todoId',
      onDelete: 'CASCADE'
    });
  };
  return TodoItem;
};
```

First, you are going to edit both attributes `content` and `complete`. With `complete` a default value is now has been added. Having a default value will allow the database to provide a value for the particular field. The `onDelete` tells the database to delete the whole todo item when from the associated todo it belongs too.

## Running the Migrations

Migrations provide a clearer picture of what our database models going to look like inside. Since you are making changes in the generated attributes and adding fields like in our case, `defaultValue`, you have to edit the migration files for each specific model wherever necessary.

Running migrations take care of creating the database table and associated column inside the table for us. This is the functionality of each `up` function in both migrations files. There is also a `down` function that is only to run when you need to undo the changes inside the database table for some reason. Open inside `migrations/<date-time>-create-todo.js` file.

```js
'use strict';
module.exports = {
  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.createTable('Todos', {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER
      },
      title: {
        type: Sequelize.STRING
      },
      createdAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE
      },
      updatedAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE
      }
    });
  },
  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.dropTable('Todos');
  }
};
```

Similar changes are made inside `migrations/<date-time>-crrate-todo-item.js`.

```js
'use strict';
module.exports = {
  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.createTable('TodoItems', {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER
      },
      content: {
        type: Sequelize.STRING
      },
      complete: {
        type: Sequelize.BOOLEAN,
        defaultValue: false
      },
      createdAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE
      },
      updatedAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE
      },
      todoId: {
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
        onDelete: 'CASCADE',
        references: {
          model: 'Todos',
          key: 'id',
          as: 'todoId'
        }
      }
    });
  },
  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.dropTable('TodoItems');
  }
};
```

In the above file, you are also defining the relationship between both the models. The `todoId` field is not going to be generated by Sequelize automatically until we define it above inside `migrations/<date-time>-crrate-todo-item.js`. Let us run the migration command and generate these models in our database. Open your terminal and execute the below command.

```shell
sequelize db:migrate
```

You will get a result like below indicating the success of the above command.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XT_pFJozGEeytKP22F8Awg.png' />

**Please Note** if the above command throws an error such as `ERROR: role "root" does not exist`. This means you do not have a username created already for `postgres`. You will have to run the following command and can follow the official documentation [**here**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/app-createuser.html) for information.

```shell
createuser <username>
```

## Building the API

Creating models might seem overwhelming if you are doing it the first time but if you have followed closely so far, you will have no problem going through the whole process next time. In this section, we are going to start building our API. You are going to create your first controller for `todos` inside a new directory and file `controllers/todos.js`. We start by requiring the `todos` model.

```js
const Todo = require('../models').Todo;

module.exports = {
  create(req, res) {
    return Todo.create({
      title: req.body.title
    })
      .then(todo => res.status(201).send(todo))
      .catch(error => res.status(400).send(error));
  }
};
```

Then, we are exporting the controller function inside which `create` function exists. This function will handle the business logic behind the route handler that we are going to define soon for creating a new todo in our database. It accepts two parameters, `req` for incoming requests and `res` to send the response back to an individual incoming request. On success, `.then()` function will trigger and send back the todo item with an HTTP status of `201`. If an error is encountered, `.catch` will return the error with an HTTP status of `400`.

You can think of each todo we create here as the name of a list of items. Right now we only are defining the business logic of creating the name for each list. Let’s complete this process and test with a REST client to see if everything works. Now we are going to connect this controller to the desired route. Create a new folder called `routes` and inside it a file called `index.js`.

```js
const todosController = require('../controllers/todos.js');

module.exports = app => {
  app.get('/api', (req, res) =>
    res.status(200).send({
      message: 'Create Your Own Todo Lists API'
    })
  );

  app.post('/api/todos', todosController.create);
};
```

In the above file, there are two routes being defined. One is `/api` which displays the welcome message and using `app.post('/api/todos`) where the request for creating a new to-do list can be send. Last step before the testing of this two new routes begin is to hook the routes inside `server.js` file.

```js
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const PORT = 4000;

app.use(express.json());
app.use(
  express.urlencoded({
    extended: true
  })
);

// app.get('/', (req, res) => {
// 	res.json({ message: 'REST API with Node.js, and Postgres API' });
// });

require('./routes/index')(app);

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at port ${PORT}.`);
});

module.exports = app;
```

To see if everything is working, let’s run the server by running `npm run start` and open your favorite REST API client like Postman [Abhinav Asthana](https://medium.com/u/94144f041644) or [Insomnia REST Client](https://medium.com/u/f5d2e9d5d710) to test the new routes. When you run the URL `http://localhost:4000/api` you will get the success message like below.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*mw85LS3bjGLqyy4-nG1oHg.png' />

Next step is to create a new todo item. Run the URL `http://localhost:4000/api/todos`.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*eEigERbZHWQLKXEeKEcsxw.png' />

So far so good. Let us create a new controller and a route that will list all the to-do lists in our database. Open `controllers/todos.js`. Add the below after `create()` function.

```js
// after create()
list(req, res) {
		return Todo.all()
			.then(todos => res.status(201).send(todos))
			.catch(error => res.status(400).send(error));
  }
```

Now open `routes/index.js` and create the new route for this logic to run.

```js
app.get('/api/todos', todosController.list);
```

Open the REST client and visit the URL `http://localhost:4000/api/todos](http://localhost:4000/api/todos`.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*70TGcibYiHPQ_jMGbHfEPw.png' />

## API for Todo Items

Since the API is responding to the logic we have written behind it, you can continue to build it. In this section, you are going to create an individual item and add it to a specific list. Start by creating a file `todoitem.js` inside `controllers/`.

```js
const TodoItem = require('../models').TodoItem;

module.exports = {
  create(req, res) {
    return TodoItem.create({
      content: req.body.content,
      todoId: req.params.todoId
    })
      .then(todoItem => res.status(201).send(todoItem))
      .catch(error => res.status(400).send(error));
  }
};
```

Next step is to add the route for it inside `routes/index.js`.

```js
const todosController = require('../controllers/todos.js');
const todoItemsController = require('../controllers/todoitem.js');

module.exports = app => {
  app.get('/api', (req, res) =>
    res.status(200).send({
      message: 'Create Your Own Todo Lists API'
    })
  );

  app.post('/api/todos', todosController.create);
  app.get('/api/todos', todosController.list);

  app.post('/api/todos/:todoId/items', todoItemsController.create);
};
```

The last step is to test this API endpoint. Run the URL `http://localhost:4000/api/todos/2/items`. Do note that the `2` in this URL is the `id` of the list that will associate this todo item to a todo list. From earlier images, you can note that I had three lists with `IDs`: `2`, `9` and `10`. If everything is going right for you, this may differ. You will have `IDs` starting from `1`.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*6ni8M5l4R3BN7Kz7xUZQtQ.png' />

Now let us modify the `list` function in `controllers/todos.js` such that it returns the todo item along with the list name.

```js
const Todo = require('../models').Todo;
const TodoItem = require('../models').TodoItem;

module.exports = {
  create(req, res) {
    return Todo.create({
      title: req.body.title
    })
      .then(todo => res.status(201).send(todo))
      .catch(error => res.status(400).send(error));
  },
  list(req, res) {
    return Todo.findAll({
      include: [
        {
          model: TodoItem,
          as: 'todoItems'
        }
      ]
    })
      .then(todos => res.status(201).send(todos))
      .catch(error => res.status(400).send(error));
  }
};
```

To test this, run the URL `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` and you will get similar result like below.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*06TUB4RzVdfsCoAoTJyHrg.png' />

Notice how the below snippet is added. This is done through the association methods we defined earlier when creating both of our models.

```json
"todoItems": [
  {
    "id": 3,
    "content": "buy milk",
    "complete": false,
    "createdAt": "2018-12-02T18:06:25.059Z",
    "updatedAt": "2018-12-02T18:06:25.059Z",
    "todoId": 2
  }
]
```

## Deleting Todo Lists

The last API endpoint we require is to delete a todo list which will further delete all items inside it as `todoItems`. Open `controllers/todos.js`.

```js
destroy(req, res) {
		return Todo.findById(req.params.todoId)
			.then(todo => {
				if (!todo) {
					return res.status(400).send({
						message: 'Todo List not found'
					});
				}
				return todo
					.destroy()
					res.status(200).send({ message: 'Todo List deleted Successfully' })
					.catch(error => res.status(400).send(error));
			})
			.catch(error => res.status(400).send(error));
  }
```

Add the corresponding route inside `routes/index.js`.

```js
app.delete('/api/todos/:todoId', todosController.destroy);
```

When you run the URL `http://localhost:4000/api/todos/2` with HTTP `DELETE` request it will respond back like below.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*6xehAdlL-W2HpJMb3ytdCg.png' />

This can also be verified by running `http://localhost:4000/api/todos`. In response, you will not see the same todo list we just deleted.

## Conclusion

That’s it! In this article, you learned about using PostgreSQL as a database and using ORM tools like Sequelize, and how to migrate data models into database properly. We learned how to connect PostgreSQL database and what the correct configuration to do so. Also, we created a REST API using Express as the back-end server framework. Our REST API can be improved with better error handling and form validation. The possibilities from here are endless. The popularity of the PostgreSQL database among developers is at its peak.
