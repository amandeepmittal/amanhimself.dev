Busy week with mix of publishing, drafting, and experimenting.

- 📝 Published a post on sharing my initial experience on [using Codex CLI](/blog/first-few-days-with-codex-cli/) outside of coding and mostly with Obsidian.
- 📝 Published a post called [2025 year in books](/blog/2025-year-in-books/). The idea of writing a full yearly review felt overwhelming, so I decided to break it down. Starting with books made it manageable.
- Drafts completed this week are two more posts. Lessons from 10 years of blogging, a reflection on a decade of running and writing on this blog. And TIL `git shortlog`, a quick tip for the CLI section.
- 💼 Many PRs this week for Expo docs &mdash; small improvements, major bug fixes, and some big changes.
- 🧪 Tried using Codex CLI 5.2 to gather docs metrics from Google Analytics, Kapa, and other sources. It lost context twice (full context both times).
  - Takeaways: need to create smaller, focused skills for this kind of task, and I should just take the screenshots myself.
- 🧪 Also experimented with building a small iOS app using Expo and React Native and Codex CLI. The goal was to write zero code, but I ended up writing around 25% of it. The upside: tightened my existing `SKILL.md` files and added more resources to them
- 📚 Started reading Seneca: A Life by Emily Wilson
