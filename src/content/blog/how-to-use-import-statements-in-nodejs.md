> **UPDATE:** Up to date version of this post is at [How to use ES6 import syntax in Node.js](https://amanhimself.dev/blog/how-to-use-es6-import-syntax-in-node/).

I donâ€™t always like to try different versions of setting up a Nodejs application. Donâ€™t get me wrongâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI believe in experimenting with oneâ€™s set up, which can lead to learning new things. But there is a limit. Recently, I find myself more often going to set up a Nodejs server to develop a RESTful API. Furthermore, the server has to work with the client in a way that the client can consume the API easily. For the client-side development, I am using ReactJS.

With the context switching between the client and the server I often find myself making errors during the process. One of the most common is using `import` statements in Nodejs files. This leads to a syntax error called `Unexpected identifier`. Even after switching to Nodejs `v10` LTS on my local machine, I find the lack of using ES6 modules rather disappointing.

To overcome this problem, and reduce the number of errors I cause during development, I read a few tutorials but decided to mesh a setup of my own. These tutorials, though well written, use methods that are almost completely opposite to one another. I want consistency when working on full-stack applications for my day job.

As a result, I m going to show you a streamlined, less time-consuming version of using `import` statements in a Nodejs server-side application. To continue to read this article, please make sure you have following applications installed on your local machine:

- Nodejs
- npm

### Getting Started With a MockÂ Project

I call it a mock project because I am going to start from scratch to build this setup. At the end of this tutorial, I will leave a link to a Github repository that can serve as a starter kit to many of your Nodejs plus Express projects. You can skip to the link part and DIYâ€Šâ€”â€Šthereâ€™s no complexity here. If youâ€™re still curious, continue to read this short piece.

To start, create a new directory, traverse inside it and initialize it with `npm`.

```shell
mkdir node-babel-setup
npm init -y
```

You can check out the `package.json` file after initializing your project as an npm project. It will be filled with details that you have used to configure npm.

```json
{
  "name": "node-babel-setup",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Aman Mittal <amandeepmittal@live.com> (www.amanhimself.me)",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Next, create a new file with the following command from your terminal:

```shell
touch index.js
```

Thatâ€™s all we need to set up a bare minimum project directory. In the next section, we take a look at what dependencies we have to install and why we need those dependencies.

### Creating the NodeÂ Server

To create a server I am going to use Express. To include Express in our project as a dependency, run the following command from your terminal:

```shell
npm install -S express
```

Next, append the `index.js` file with the following code:

```js
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Nodejs!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ at port ${PORT}`);
});
```

You can run the server by running the command `node index.js`. Visit URL `http://localhost:3000/` and youâ€™ll see a message displayed in the browser window: `Hello from Nodejs!`.

This indicates that the code for the server is fine. Now modify the first line of `index.js` to:

```js
import express from 'express';
```

Run the same command `node index.js` and stay at the terminal window. This time the server does not start as there is an error in the process. Itâ€™s the same error I told you about at the start of this article. Nodejs cannot execute `import` statements by default.

### Using Babel

All we need is a transpiler, which allows us to write JavaScript using ES6 features such as `import` statements in our Nodejs project. _Whatâ€™s a transpiler?_

> Transpilers are also known as source-to-source compilers that read code from source written in one programming language and produce an equivalent code in another language.

In our case weâ€™re not switching programming languages, rather we need to use new language features that are not yet supported by the LTS version of Node. Iâ€™m going to set up Babel compiler and enable it in our project by going through the following configuration process:

First, you will have to install few dependencies. Do mind -D flag as we only need these dependencies for our development environment:

```shell
npm install -D babel-cli babel-preset-env babel-watch
```

Once you have installed them, add aÂ `.babelrc` file to the root of the project and add the following config:

```json
{
  "presets": ["env"]
}
```

The last step in the configuration process is to add a `dev` script in `package.json`. You can name this script whatever you like. This will take care of running the babel compiler on its own (automate) once there is a change. This done by `babel-watch` that also takes care of re-starting Nodejs web server.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "babel-watch index.js",
}
```

To see it action make sure the following code to your `index.js` uses `import` statement like below.

```js
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ at port ${PORT}`);
});
```

From terminal write `nr dev`. If there are no errors, youâ€™ll get the following:

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Rz9TPPfk6B4p4NPTntXKvg.png' />

Where `nr` is shorthand for `npm run`. You can also visit `http://localhost3000/` in your browser to verify the result and see if the server is working or not.

### Conclusion

This article has shown you how to create a bare minimum Node server from scratch, and how you can introduce upcoming JavaScript features in your Node.js environment using Babel. Iâ€™m sure now you are not going to make the same silly errors like me in _Nodejs_ + _insert a frontend framework/library of your choice_ as I did.
