Styling is an important aspect of any mobile application. You cannot put enough emphasis on how important it is for a mobile app to have a pleasing design and good use of colors for the app users to use it in the long term.

If you are into React Native development, by now, you may know that there are different ways to style a React Native application. Methods such as by using `StyleSheet` object to create to styles for each component screen, or [encapsulating all of your styles](https://hackernoon.com/styling-the-react-native-way-3cc6d3ef52d0) in one file for the whole application.

Using third-party libraries for styling is another way that can save you a lot of time to develop your React Native application. Some CSS-in-JS libraries such as styled components and emotion-js are already a common practice among web developers. This tutorial is going to discuss and showcase how you can use [Emotion-JS](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) in a React Native application.

## What is Emotion-JS üë©‚Äçüé§?

Emotion is a flexible _CSS-in-JS_ library that somehow enforces developers to write each component with their own styles and has both of them in one place. This enforcement has lead to some happy times for some happy developers resulting in optimizing their experience and output. It has predictable composition to avoid specificity issues with CSS.

React Native tends to follow a certain convention when it comes to styling your app. Such as all CSS property names should be in camelCase such as for background-color in React Native is:

```css
background-color: 'papayawhip';
```

Developers coming from a web background, do get uncomfortable by these conventions. Using a third party library like emotion-js can give help you. You do not have to switch between the context of conventions, apart from the properties and React Native‚Äôs own `flexbox` rules.

## Installing Emotion

To get started, you need a new React Native project. To quickly scaffold one, let us use the power of Expo. Run the following command to install expo cli and create a new React Native project using the same cli.

```shell
# To install expo-cli

npm install -S expo-cli

# Generate a project

expo init rn-emotion-demo
```

When running the last command, the command line prompt will you a few questions. First one is, Choose a template, where I chose `expo-template-blank`, then enter display name of your app and then either use `npm` or `yarn` to install dependencies. I am going with `yarn`.

Once all the dependencies installed, you can open this project in your favorite code editor. Next step is to install the latest version of emotion library.

```shell
yarn add prop-types @emotion/core @emotion/native
```

Guidelines in [emotion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/native) package instructs that you need `prop-types` as the package installed with your project since Emotion as the package itself depends on it. Next two packages in the above command are necessary to use the library itself. Also, make sure, when you install these dependencies, you are inside the React Native project directory.

## Writing your first Emotion Style

To start the application in a simulator, run `expo start`. On successfully starting the application, you will be prompted with the default Expo app. Modify the `App.js` file like below to get started. Make changes to the component‚Äôs render function like below. Replace both `View` and `Text` with `Container` and `Title`. These new elements are going to be custom using semantics from emotion.

```js
export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Title>React Native with üë©‚Äçüé§ Emotion</Title>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}
```

Emotion-JS utilizes tagged template literals to style your components using back-ticks. When creating a component in React or React Native using this styling library, each component is going to have styles attached to it. Define the below styles in the same file after the `App` component.

```js
const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background-color: papayawhip;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const Title = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: palevioletred;
`;
```

Notice the `Container` is a React Native `View` and has styling attached to it. Similarly, `Title` is utilizing `Text` component from React Native. You will get the following result.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*f74HA6IWnJM-cE_BNE9CTQ.png' />

Here is the complete code for `App.js` file.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import styled, { css } from '@emotion/native';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Title>React Native with üë©‚Äçüé§ Emotion</Title>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background-color: papayawhip;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const Title = styled.Text`
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: palevioletred;
`;
```

In the above snippet, do take a note that we are not importing a React Native core components such as `View`, `Text` or `StyleSheet` object. It is that simple. It uses the same `flexbox` model that React Native Layouts use. The advantage here is that you get to apply almost similar context and understandable syntax that you have been using in Web Development to style a React Native application.

## Using Props in Emotion-JS

Often you will find yourself creating custom components for your apps. This does give you the advantage to stay DRY. Leveraging emotion-js is no different. You can use this programming pattern by building custom components that require their parent components. `props` are commonly known as additional properties to a specific component. To demonstrate this, create a new file called `CustomButton.js`.

Inside this file, we are going to create a custom button that requires props such as `backgroundColor`, `textColor` and the `text` itself for the title of the button. You are going to use `TouchableOpacity` and `Text` to create this custom button but without importing `react-native` library and create a functional component `CustomButton`.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled, { css } from '@emotion/native';

const CustomButton = props => (
  <ButtonContainer
    onPress={() => alert('You are using Emotion-JS!')}
    backgroundColor={props.backgroundColor}
  >
    <ButtonText textColor={props.textColor}>{props.text}</ButtonText>
  </ButtonContainer>
);

export default CustomButton;

const ButtonContainer = styled.TouchableOpacity`
  margin: 15px;
    width: 100px;
    height: 40px
    padding: 12px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    background-color: ${props => props.backgroundColor};
`;

const ButtonText = styled.Text`
  font-size: 15px;
  color: ${props => props.textColor};
  text-align: center;
`;
```

The important thing to notice in the above snippet is you can pass an interpolated function `${props => props...}` to an emotion-js template literal to extend it the component's style and keep the component re-usable.

To see this custom button in action, import it to the `App.js` file as below.

```js
// ... other imports
import CustomButton from './components/CustomButton';

// ...

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Title>React Native with üë©‚Äçüé§ Emotion</Title>
        <CustomButton
          text="Click Me"
          textColor="#01d1e5"
          backgroundColor="lavenderblush"
        />
      </Container>
    );
  }
}
```

On running the simulator, you will get the following result.

## Inline Styling

As React Native developer, you have used inline styling and you know how beneficial they can be, especially in the prototypal stage of an application.

To leverage this technique using Emotion-js, open `CustomButton.js` file and add an inline style like below. Do note that, we are not modifying the existing styles defined previously.

```js
const CustomButton = props => (
    <ButtonContainer
        onPress={() => alert("You are using Emotion-JS!")}
        backgroundColor={props.backgroundColor}
        style={css`
            border-width: 1px;
        `}
    >
        <ButtonText textColor={props.textColor}>{props.text}</ButtonText>
    </ButtonContainer>
```

The `style` tag in the above snippet uses `css` prop from `@emotion/native` library to allow us to add inline styles.

## Building the Grocery UI

Onwards this section, you are going to use what you have just learned about Emotion-js by building a better UI in terms of complexity than a simple test and a button.

Open up App.js. Declare a new `ContainerView` using styled prop from emotion-js. Inside the backticks, you can put pure CSS code there with the exact same syntax. The View element is like a div in HTML or web programming in general. Also, create another view called `Titlebar` inside `Container`.

Inside `Titlebar`, it will contain three new elements. One is going to be an image `Avatar` and the other two are text: `Title` and `Name`.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled, { css } from '@emotion/native';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Titlebar>
          <Avatar />
          <Title>Welcome back,</Title>
          <Name>Aman</Name>
        </Titlebar>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background-color: white;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const Titlebar = styled.View`
  width: 100%;
  margin-top: 50px;
  padding-left: 80px;
`;

const Avatar = styled.Image``;

const Title = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: #b8bece;
`;

const Name = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  color: #333333;
  font-weight: bold;
`;
```

You will get the following result in the simulator.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NOix_tBDR5Ya7U9vxKBWkA.png' />

Right now, everything is how in the middle of the screen. We need the `Titlebar` and its contents at the top of the mobile screen. So styles for `Container` can be modified as below.

```js
const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background-color: white;
`;
```

You will get the following result.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_y_4hWxNgScpmXjtJQngXQ.png' />

## Adding the user avatar image

I am going to use an image that is stored in the assets folder in the root of our project. If are free to use your own image but you can also download the assets for this project below.

- [rn-emotion-demo](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/rn-emotion-demo/tree/master/assets)

To create an image even with emotion-js, you need the `Image` component from React Native core. You can use the source props to reference the image based on where it is located.

```js
<Titlebar>
  <Avatar source={require('./assets/avatar.jpg')} />
  <Title>Welcome back,</Title>
  <Name>Aman</Name>
</Titlebar>
```

The styling for Avatar will begin with a width and a height each of `44` pixels.

```js
const Avatar = styled.Image`
  width: 44px;
  height: 44px;
`;
```

You will get the following result.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*86D8gQeBHwo42NwJ2bKbkA.png' />

## Absolute Positioning in React Native

Now notice that the avatar image and the text are piling up. They are taking the same space on the screen. To avoid this, you are going to use `position: absolute` CSS property.

CSS properties such as `padding` and `margin` are used to add space between UI elements in relation to one another. This is the default layout position. However, you are currently in a scenario where it will be beneficial to use absolute positioning of UI elements and place the desired UI element at the exact position you want.

In React Native and CSS in general, if `position` property is set to `absolute`, then the element is laid out relative to its parent. CSS has other values for `position` but React Native only supports `absolute`.

Modify `Avatar` styles as below.

```js
const Avatar = styled.Image`
  width: 44px;
  height: 44px;
  margin-left: 20px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
`;
```

Usually, with position absolute property, you are going to use a combination of the following properties:

- top
- left
- right
- bottom

In the case above, we use `top` and `left` and both are set to `0` pixels. You will get the following output.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VyDbIWkN4io9aMFw9-Jucg.png' />

## Mapping through a list of categories

Inside `components/` folder create a new file called `Categories.js`. This file is going to render a list of category items for the Grocery UI app.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled, { css } from '@emotion/native';

const Categories = props => (
  <Container>
    <Name>Fruits</Name>
    <Name>Bread</Name>
    <Name>Drinks</Name>
    <Name>Veggies</Name>
  </Container>
);

export default Categories;

const Container = styled.View``;

const Name = styled.Text`
  font-size: 28px;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-left: 15px;
  color: #bcbece;
`;
```

All the data is static right now. Import this component in `App.js` and place it after `Titlebar`.

```js
<Container>
  <Titlebar>
    <Avatar source={require('./assets/avatar.jpg')} />
    <Title>Welcome back,</Title>
    <Name>Aman</Name>
  </Titlebar>
  <Categories />
</Container>
```

You will get the following result.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UzOFxbJegk5DgdnWIIDFAA.png' />

There can be a number of categories. To make the names of categories dynamic, we can send it through `App.js` file.

```js
const items = [
  { text: 'Fruits' },
  { text: 'Bread' },
  { text: 'Drinks' },
  { text: 'Veggies' },
  { text: 'Meat' },
  { text: 'Paper Goods' }
];

// ...

// Inside the render function replace <Categories /> with

{
  items.map((category, index) => (
    <Categories name={category.text} key={index} />
  ));
}
```

In the above snippet, you are using `map` function from JavaScript to iterate through an array render a list of items, in this category names. Adding a `key` prop is required. To make this work, also modify `Categories.js`.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled, { css } from '@emotion/native';

const Categories = props => <Name>{props.name}</Name>;

export default Categories;

const Name = styled.Text`
  font-size: 28px;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-left: 15px;
  color: #bcbece;
`;
```

There is no change in the UI.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*97cGkaf4B-iuoBqtaU_82g.png' />

## Adding Horizontal ScrollView

This list is right now not scrollable. To make it scrollable, let us place it inside a `ScrollView`. Open up `App.js` file place the categories inside a `ScrollView`, but first, import it from React Native core.

```js
import { ScrollView } from 'react-native';

//...
<ScrollView>
  {items.map((category, index) => (
    <Categories name={category.text} key={index} />
  ))}
</ScrollView>;
```

You will notice not a single change in the UI. By default, scrollable lists in React Native using `ScrollView` are `vertical`. Make this horizontal by adding the prop `horizontal`.

```js
<ScrollView horizontal={true} showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}>
  {items.map((category, index) => (
    <Categories name={category.text} key={index} />
  ))}
</ScrollView>
```

It works.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ca8deMUYzKMefqll-U8d2w.gif' />

To make it appear better, add some inline styling using `css` prop.

```js
<ScrollView
    horizontal={true}
    showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
    style={css`
    margin: 20px;
    margin-left: 12px;
    `}
>
```

Now it looks better.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Wv5LHX6N-LNKYFBLnzZZjw.gif' />

## Adding a vertical ScrollView

Next step is to add a `ScrollView` that acts as a wrapper inside the `Container` view such that the whole area becomes scrollable vertically. There is a reason to do this. You are now going to add items separated into two columns as images with texts related to a particular category.

Modify `App.js` file.

```js
return (
  <Container>
    <ScrollView>
      <Titlebar>{/* and its contents */}</Titlebar>
      <ScrollView horizontal={true}>
        {/* Categories being rendered */}
      </ScrollView>
      <Subtitle>Items</Subtitle>
    </ScrollView>
  </Container>
);
```

Notice that we are adding another emotion component called `Subtitle` which is nothing but a text.

It renders like below.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pm3WO-qUP4JhE3yagUo93A.png' />

## Building a card component

In this section, we are going to create a card component that will hold an item‚Äôs image, the name of the item and the price as text. Each card component is going to have curved borders and box shadow. This is how it is going to look like.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LACepyEU54zhnt028sfh5g.png' />

Create a new component file called `Card.js` inside the `components` directory. The structure of the Card component is going to be.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled, { css } from '@emotion/native';

const Card = props => (
  <Container>
    <Cover>
      <Image source={require('../assets/pepper.jpg')} />
    </Cover>
    <Content>
      <Title>Pepper</Title>
      <PriceCaption>$ 2.99 each</PriceCaption>
    </Content>
  </Container>
);

export default Card;
```

Currently, it has static data, such as the image, title, and content. Let us add the styles for each styled UI elements in this file.

```js
const Container = styled.View`
  background: #fff;
  height: 200px;
  width: 150px;
  border-radius: 14px;
  margin: 18px;
  margin-top: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
`;

const Cover = styled.View`
  width: 100%;
  height: 120px;
  border-top-left-radius: 14px;
  border-top-right-radius: 14px;
  overflow: hidden;
`;

const Image = styled.Image`
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
`;

const Content = styled.View`
  padding-top: 10px;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  height: 60px;
`;

const Title = styled.Text`
  color: #3c4560;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 600;
`;

const PriceCaption = styled.Text`
  color: #b8b3c3;
  font-size: 15px;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-top: 4px;
`;
```

The `Container` view has a default background of white color. This is useful in scenarios where you are fetching images from a third party APIs. Also, it provides a background to the text area below the image.

Inside the `Container` view, add an `Image` and wrap it inside a `Cover` view. In React Native there two ways you can fetch an image.

If you are getting an image from the static resource as in our case, you use `source` prop with the keyword `require` that contains the relative path to the image asset stored in the project folder. In case of networking images or getting an image from an API, you use the same prop with a different keyword called `uri`. Here is an example of an image being fetched from an API.

```js
<Image
  source={{
    uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/assets/favicon.png'
  }}
/>
```

The `Cover` view uses rounded corners with `overflow` property. This is done to reflect the rounded corners. iOS clips the images if coming from a child component. In our case, the image is coming from a `Card` component which is a child to the `App` component.

The `Image` component takes the width and height of the entire `Cover` view.

Now let us import this component inside App.js file, after the `Subtitle` and let us see what results do we get.

```js
render() {
    return (
    <Container>
        <ScrollView>
        {/* ... */}
        <Subtitle>Items</Subtitle>
            <ItemsLayout>
                <ColumnOne>
                    <Card />
                </ColumnOne>
                <ColumnTwo>
                    <Card />
                </ColumnTwo>
            </ItemsLayout>
        </ScrollView>
    </Container>
    )
}

// ...

const ItemsLayout = styled.View`
    flex-direction: row;
    flex: 1;
`;

const ColumnOne = styled.View``;

const ColumnTwo = styled.View``;
```

After `Subtitle` adds a new view called `ItemsLayout`. This is going to be a layout that allows different cards to be divided between two columns in each row. This can be done by giving this view a `flex-direction` property of value `row`. `ColumnOne` and `ColumnTwo` are two empty views.

On rendering the final result, it looks like below.
