### Introduction

Whether you are a web developer or mobile app developer, you know that without the proper styling of your application, the UI would probably suck. Styling an application is important. I cannot put enough emphasis on how important it is for a mobile app to have a pleasing design and good use of colors.

If you are getting into React Native or have already dipped your toes, you know that there are different ways you can style a React Native app. I have already discussed the basics and some of the different ways to style your React Native components in the article below. Such as, to create a new style object you use `**StyleSheet.create()**` method and encapsulating them. Go check it out 👇

This tutorial is going to be about styling your React Native apps using [💅 Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics 'https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics'). Yes, styled-components is a third party library. Using it is a matter of choice, but also another way to add styling to your app, and many might find it easy to use, especially if you have used this library before with other frameworks. One common use case is web apps built with React.

### What are Styled Components?

Styled Components is a _CSS-in-JS_ library that enables developers to write each component with their own styles and allows the code to be in a single location. By coupling your styles with the components, it results in optimizing developer experience and output.

In React Native, the styling of components is already done by creating JavaScript objects and if you do not [**encapsulate them**](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/styling-the-react-native-way-3cc6d3ef52d0), in most cases, your components and their styling are going to end up in one place.

React Native tends to follow a certain convention when it comes to styling your app. Such as all CSS property names should be in `camelCase` such as for `background-color` in React Native is:

```css
backgroundcolor: 'blue';
```

Occasionally, web developers get uncomfortable by these conventions. Using a third party library like styled components can give you wings. You do not have to switch between the context of conventions much, apart from the properties and React Native’s own Flexbox rules.

Behind the scenes, styled components just converts the CSS text into a React Native stylesheet object. You can check how it does that [**here**](https://github.com/styled-components/css-to-react-native 'https://github.com/styled-components/css-to-react-native')**.**

_Enough with story, let’s get to work!_

### Installing Styled Components

To install the `styled-components` library in a React Native project, we will first initialize the app. To get started quickly, I am going to use the awesome **Expo** library. Make sure you have `expo-cli` installed.

```shell
# To install expo-cli

npm install -S expo-cli

# Generate a project

expo init [YourApp-Name]
```

When running the last command, the command line prompt will you a few questions. First one is, `Choose a template`, where I chose `expo-template-blank`, then enter display name of your app and then either use `npm` or `yarn` to install dependencies. I am using `npm`.

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can open this project in your favorite code editor. The next step is to install the latest version of `styled-components` library.

```shell
npm install -S styled-components
```

That’s it for installation.

### Using Styled Components

Open up `App.js` file and make some modifications.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center'
  }
});
```

From your terminal, run the command: `npm run ios` if you are on macOS. For Linux and Windows users the command is `npm run android`, but make sure you have an Android virtual device running in the background. Our code currently looks like below.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FJYy0ggO0KlAjamE81Z19w.png' />

Let’s make some changes to it and use our newly installed library. To get started, import the library like below.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

Make changes to the component’s render function like below. Replace both `View` and `Text` with `Container` and `Title`. These new elements are going to be custom using semantics from `styled-components`.

```js
export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Title>React Native with 💅 Styled Components</Title>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}
```

`styled-components` utilizes tagged template literals to style your components using backticks. When creating a component in React or React Native using `styled-components`, each component is going to have styles attached to it.

Notice the Container is a React Native `View` and has styling attached to it.

```js
const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background-color: papayawhip;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const Title = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: palevioletred;
`;
```

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FJYy0ggO0KlAjamE81Z19w.png' />

The complete code for `App.js` file after changes.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Title>React Native with 💅 Styled Components</Title>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background-color: papayawhip;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const Title = styled.Text`
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: palevioletred;
`;
```

In the above snippet, do take a note that we are not importing a React Native core components such as `View`, `Text`, or the `StyleSheet` object. It is that simple. It uses the same `flexbox` model that React Native Layouts. The advantage here is that you get the advantage of using the same understandable syntax that you have been using in web development and standard CSS.

### Using Props in Styled Components

Often you will find yourself creating custom components for your apps. This does give you the advantage to stay DRY. Using `styled-components` is no different. You can leverage this programming pattern by building custom components that require their parent components. `props` are commonly known as additional properties to a specific component. To demonstrate this, create a new file called `CustomButton.js`.

Inside this file, we are going to create a custom button that requires props such as `backgroundColor`, `textColor` and the text itself for the button. You are going to use `TouchableOpacity` and `Text` to create this custom button but without importing `react-native` library using a functional component `CustomButton`.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const CustomButton = props => (
  <ButtonContainer
    onPress={() => alert('Hi!')}
    backgroundColor={props.backgroundColor}
  >
    <ButtonText textColor={props.textColor}>{props.text}</ButtonText>
  </ButtonContainer>
);

export default CustomButton;

const ButtonContainer = styled.TouchableOpacity`
	width: 100px;
	height: 40px
	padding: 12px;
	border-radius: 10px;
	background-color: ${props => props.backgroundColor};
`;

const ButtonText = styled.Text`
  font-size: 15px;
  color: ${props => props.textColor};
  text-align: center;
`;
```

By passing an interpolated function `${props => props...}` to a styled component's template literal you can extend its styles. Now add this button to `App.js` file.

```js

render() {
		return (
			<Container>
				<Title>React Native with 💅 Styled Components</Title>
				<CustomButton text="Click Me" textColor="#01d1e5" backgroundColor="lavenderblush" />
			</Container>
		);
  }
```

On running the simulator, you will get the following result.

### Building the app — Grocery UI

In this section we are building a UI screen for an app that would be used for a grocery store. You are going to build the home screen that looks like the one below.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qRd6EyuiB_nvs3jolhOCeA.png' />

We will be using our knowledge of `styled-components` so let's get started! Open up `App.js`. Declare a new `Container` `View` using `styled`. Inside the backticks, you can put pure CSS code there with the exact same syntax. The `View` element is like a `div` in HTML or web programming in general. Also, create another view called `Titlebar` inside `Container`.

Inside `Titlebar`, it will contain three new elements. One is going to be an image `Avatar` and the other two are text: `Title`and `Name`.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Titlebar>
          <Avatar />
          <Title>Welcome back,</Title>
          <Name>Aman</Name>
        </Titlebar>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background-color: white;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const Titlebar = styled.View`
  width: 100%;
  margin-top: 50px;
  padding-left: 80px;
`;

const Avatar = styled.Image``;

const Title = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: #b8bece;
`;

const Name = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  color: #3c4560;
  font-weight: bold;
`;
```

Run `npm run ios` and see it in action.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QWsjF7juUsD8wHsuD_4M-A.png' />

Right now, the content is in the middle of the screen. We need the `Titlebar` and its contents at the top of the mobile screen. So styles for `Container` will be as below.

```js
const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background-color: white;
`;
```

### Adding user avatar image

I am going to use an image that is stored in `assets` folder in the root of our project. You are free to use your own image but you can also download the assets for this project below.

[**amandeepmittal/react-native-workspace**
\_⚛️ + 📱 React Native Things. Contribute to amandeepmittal/react-native-workspace development by creating an account on…\_github.com](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/react-native-workspace/tree/master/03-RNgrocery-ui/assets 'https://github.com/amandeepmittal/react-native-workspace/tree/master/03-RNgrocery-ui/assets')[](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/react-native-workspace/tree/master/03-RNgrocery-ui/assets)

To create an image with `styled-components`, you need the `Image` component. You can use the `source` props to reference the image based on where it is located.

```js
<Titlebar>
  <Avatar source={require('./assets/avatar.jpg')} />
  <Title>Welcome back,</Title>
  <Name>Aman</Name>
</Titlebar>
```

The styling for `Avatar` will begin with a width and height of `44` pixels. Having a `border-radius` exactly half the value of width and height, which makes the image a circle. `border-radius` is the property that you will be using frequently to create rounded corners.

```js
const Avatar = styled.Image`
  width: 44px;
  height: 44px;
  background: black;
  border-radius: 22px;
  margin-left: 20px;
`;
```

You will get the following result.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AR9C05E4OOHGmWVkrnxjVQ.png' />

Now notice that the avatar image and the text are piling up. They are taking the same space on the screen. To avoid this, you are going to use `position: absolute` CSS property.

### Absolute Positioning in React Native

CSS properties such as `padding` and `margin` are used to add space between UI elements in relation to one another. This is the default layout position. However, you are currently in a scenario where it will be beneficial to use absolute positioning of UI elements and place the desired UI element at the exact position you want.

In React Native and CSS in general, if `position` property is set to `absolute`, then the element is laid out relative to its parent. CSS has other values for `position` but React Native only supports `absolute`.

Modify `Avatar` styles as below.

```js
const Avatar = styled.Image`
  width: 44px;
  height: 44px;
  background: black;
  border-radius: 22px;
  margin-left: 20px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
`;
```

Usually, with position absolute property, you are going to use a combination of the following properties:

- top
- left
- right
- bottom

In our case above, we use `top` and `left` both set to `0` pixels. You will get the following output.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xuQEJUyE0rGBNCuzz14ajw.png' />

### Adding icons in a React Native

Expo boilerplate comes with a set of different icon libraries such as Ionicons, FontAwesome, Glyphicons, Material icons and many more. The complete list of icons you can find [**here**](https://expo.github.io/vector-icons/), a searchable website.

To use the library, all you have to do is write the import statement.

```js
import { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons';
```

Inside the `Titlebar` view, add the icon.

```js
<Titlebar>
  {/* ... */}
  <Ionicons name="md-cart" size={32} color="red" />
</Titlebar>
```

Each icon needs props for the name that you can choose, size and color. Right now, if you look at the simulator, you will notice the same problem we had when adding the avatar image. There is no space between the icon and other UI elements inside the title bar.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k0ongnUA5ZLGzvK-QBDvXQ.png' />

To solve this, let us use the absolute positioning property as an inline style to `<Ionicons />`.

```js
<Ionicons
  name="md-cart"
  size={32}
  color="red"
  style={{ position: 'absolute', right: 20, top: 5 }}
/>
```

Why an inline style? Because `Ionicons` is not generated using styled-components.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EjxFzga9cQWUDNXesQ5KkA.png' />

### Mapping through a List

Inside `components/` folder create a new file called `Categories.js`. This file is going to render a list of category items for the Grocery UI app.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Categories = props => (
  <Container>
    <Name>Fruits</Name>
    <Name>Bread</Name>
    <Name>Drinks</Name>
    <Name>Veggies</Name>
  </Container>
);

export default Categories;

const Container = styled.View``;

const Name = styled.Text`
  font-size: 32px;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-left: 15px;
  color: #bcbece;
`;
```

All the data is static right now. Import this component in `App.js` and place it after `Titlebar`.

```js
import Categories from './components/Categories';

// ...

return (
  <Container>
    <Titlebar>{/* ... */}</Titlebar>
    <Categories />
  </Container>
);
```

You will get the following output.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kkLH38JDwcNg6gNCBFs-eA.png' />

There can be a number of categories. To make the names of categories dynamic, we can send it through `App.js`file.

```js
const Items = [
  { text: 'Fruits' },
  { text: 'Bread' },
  { text: 'Drinks' },
  { text: 'Veggies' },
  { text: 'Meat' },
  { text: 'Paper Goods' }
];

// Inside the render function replace <Categories /> with

{
  items.map((category, index) => (
    <Categories name={category.text} key={index} />
  ));
}
```

In the above snippet, you are using the `map` function from JavaScript to iterate through an array render a list of items, in this category names. Adding a `key` prop is required. To make this work, also modify `Categories.js`.

```js
const Categories = props => <Name>{props.name}</Name>;
```

### Adding Horizontal ScrollView

This list is right now not scrollable. To make it scrollable, let us place it inside a `ScrollView`. Open up `App.js` file place the categories inside a `ScrollView`, but first, import it from React Native core.

```js
import { ScrollView } from 'react-native';

// ...
<ScrollView>
  {items.map((category, index) => (
    <Categories name={category.text} key={index} />
  ))}
</ScrollView>;
```

You will notice not a single change in the UI. By default scrollable lists in React Native using `ScrollView` are vertical. Make this horizontal by adding the prop `horizontal`.

```js
<ScrollView horizontal={true}>
  {items.map((category, index) => (
    <Categories name={category.text} key={index} />
  ))}
</ScrollView>
```

It works but does not looks good.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ynb8YhFnnn56-nLYqSPThg.gif' />

Let us add some inline styles to the `ScrollView`.

```js
<ScrollView
  horizontal={true}
  style={{
    padding: 20,
    paddingLeft: 12,
    paddingTop: 30,
    flexDirection: 'row'
  }}
  showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
>
  {items.map((category, index) => (
    <Categories name={category.text} key={index} />
  ))}
</ScrollView>
```

Now it looks better. The prop `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator` hides the horizontal scroll bar that by default appears beneath the name of the categories.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IYqopJpgJkPAyif2slhVEw.png' />

### Adding a vertical ScrollView

Next step is to add a `ScrollView` that acts as a wrapper inside the `Container` view such that the whole area becomes scrollable vertically. There is a reason to do this. You are now going to have items separated into two columns as images with texts related to a particular category.

Modify `App.js` file.

```js
return (
  <Container>
    <ScrollView>
      <Titlebar>{/* and its contents */}</Titlebar>
      <ScrollView horizontal={true}>
        {/* Categories being rendered */}
      </ScrollView>
      <Subtitle>Items</Subtitle>
    </ScrollView>
  </Container>
);
```

Notice that we are adding another styled component called `Subtitle` which is nothing but a text.

```js
const Subtitle = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  color: #3c4560;
  font-weight: 500;
  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-left: 25px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
`;
```

It renders like below.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X9Db80WNDFSLRVGC1sdkWw.png' />

### Building a card component

In this section, we are going to create a card component that will hold an item’s image, the name of the item and the price as text. Each card component is going to have curved borders and box shadow. This is how it is going to look like.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bNCJQ4koGEZVKtbGu6EeqA.png' />

Create a new component file called `Card.js` inside `components` directory. The structure of the `Card` component is going to be.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Card = props => (
  <Container>
    <Cover>
      <Image source={require('../assets/pepper.jpg')} />
    </Cover>
    <Content>
      <Title>Pepper</Title>
      <PriceCaption>$ 2.99 each</PriceCaption>
    </Content>
  </Container>
);

export default Card;
```

Currently, it has static data, such as the image, title, and content. Let us add the styles for each styled UI elements in this file.

```js
const Container = styled.View`
  background: #fff;
  height: 200px;
  width: 150px;
  border-radius: 14px;
  margin: 18px;
  margin-top: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
`;

const Cover = styled.View`
  width: 100%;
  height: 120px;
  border-top-left-radius: 14px;
  border-top-right-radius: 14px;
  overflow: hidden;
`;

const Image = styled.Image`
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
`;

const Content = styled.View`
  padding-top: 10px;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  height: 60px;
`;

const Title = styled.Text`
  color: #3c4560;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 600;
`;

const PriceCaption = styled.Text`
  color: #b8b3c3;
  font-size: 15px;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-top: 4px;
`;
```

The `Container` view has a default background of white color. This is useful in scenarios where you are fetching images from a third party APIs. Also, it provides a background to the text area below the image.

Inside the `Container` view, add an `Image` and wrap it inside a `Cover` view. In React Native there two ways you can fetch an image

If you are getting an image from the static resource as in our case, you use `source` prop with keyword `require` that contains the relative path to the image asset stored in the project folder. In case of networking images or getting an image from an API, you use the same prop with a different keyword called `uri`. Here is an example of an image being fetched from an API.

```js
<Image
  source={{
    uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/assets/favicon.png'
  }}
/>
```

The `Cover` view uses rounded corners with `overflow` property. This is done to reflect the rounded corners. iOS clips the images if coming from a child component. In our case, the image is coming from a `Card` component which is a child to `App` component.

The `Image` component takes the width and height of the entire `Cover` view.

Now let us import this component inside `App.js` file, after the `Subtitle` and let us see what results do we get.

```js
render() {
	return (
	<Container>
		<ScrollView>
		{/* ... */}
		<Subtitle>Items</Subtitle>
			<ItemsLayout>
				<ColumnOne>
					<Card />
				</ColumnOne>
				<ColumnTwo>
					<Card />
				</ColumnTwo>
			</ItemsLayout>
		</ScrollView>
	</Container>
	)
}

// ...

const ItemsLayout = styled.View`
	flex-direction: row;
	flex: 1;
`;

const ColumnOne = styled.View``;

const ColumnTwo = styled.View``;
```

After `Subtitle`add a new view called `ItemsLayout`. This is going to be a layout that allows different cards to be divided between two columns in each row. This can be done by giving this view a `flex-direction` property of value `row`. `ColumnOne` and `ColumnTwo` are two empty views.

On rendering the screen of the simulator, looks like below.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qRd6EyuiB_nvs3jolhOCeA.png' />
