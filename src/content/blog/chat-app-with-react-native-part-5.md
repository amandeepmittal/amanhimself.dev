In [part 4](https://amanhimself.dev/blog/chat-app-with-react-native-part-4), we built the foundation of creating a chat app by adding UI screens that are focused on sending, receiving and displaying chat messages. We used `react-native-gifted-chat` an amazing open source library and dived deep to use its "out of the box" props to add features to the chat app.

In part 5, we are going to connect every chat functionality that we built so far with a real-time database service from Firebase, called Firestore. You are going to learn

- store chat messages of each thread/chat room in Firestore collection
- how to create sub collections inside a Firestore collection
- add a feature to display most recent message for each chat room on home screen
- fetch data from a Firestore collection

And few other things along the way. Let's get started.

## How to get current user information in the app?

Remember, in [part 2](https://amanhimself.dev/blog/chat-app-with-react-native-part-2), when configuring Email authentication between the chat app and the Firebase service, you set the following `AuthProvider` that gives access to the current user as well other methods that are already being used in components `LoginScreen` and `SignupScreen`. Here is the ode for `src/navigation/AuthProvider.js` for your reference.

```js
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';
import auth from '@react-native-firebase/auth';

/**
 * This provider is created
 * to access user in whole app
 */

export const AuthContext = createContext({});

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider
      value={{
        user,
        setUser,
        login: async (email, password) => {
          try {
            await auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
          } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
          }
        },
        register: async (email, password) => {
          try {
            await auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
          } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
          }
        },
        logout: async () => {
          try {
            await auth().signOut();
          } catch (e) {
            console.error(e);
          }
        }
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

To fetch the logged in user information (aka the current user), start by importing `AuthContext` in the file `RoomScreen.js`.

```js
// ... rest of the import statements
import React, { useContext, useEffect } from 'react';
import { AuthContext } from '../navigation/AuthProvider';
```

Next, to verify that the you are getting the current user information, inside the `RoomScreen` component, add the following two lines.

```js
export default function RoomScreen({ route }) {
  const { user } = useContext(AuthContext);
  const currentUser = user.toJSON();

  // ...
}
```

You have to convert the user data being fetched in JSON object. To check that the user data is incoming, let us temporarily add a `useEffect` hook after the previous code snippet, as shown below.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log({ user });
}, []);
```

## How to use Chrome Dev tools with a React Native app?

There are two ways to check the output of console statements in a React Native app. First, a console statement triggers, in the terminal window, the will be a `LOG` entry like below with desired result.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vgS3rCFKAkxb6WHHbESkvA.png' />

However, for better complete control over [debugging](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging), you can use Chrome dev tools. This can be done by opening the in-app developer menu, either by shaking the device or if you are using an iOS simulator press `command + d`. On Android, you have to press `command + m` on mac (for windows, press `control + m`).

A developer menu like below will popup.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*eQVIYyJTWubyIp20NSTpiQ.png' />

Select the option `Debug`. In your default Chrome browser, it is going to open like below.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1066/1*t-56v6dq-N4T955hoj28cw.png' />

Go to **Console** tab. Enter a chat room from the app. If you do not have to created a chat room yet, create one. On the Console tab, you are going to get the following result.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*rl94NSCpjYETiy0HAKYk4A.png' />

That's it. Now, from the above image, you can definitely verify that a user is logged in and their email credentials can be verified.

## How to store messages in Firestore?

In this section, you are going to add the business logic as well as the ability to store the chat conversation between multiple users in a chat room. These messages are going to be stored in a sub collection.

The main reason to create a sub collection is that when a new chat room is created, storing every data associated to that chat room in its own collection is a good idea. That said, when a new chat room is created, inside the collection `THREADS` a new document with a unique identifier is generated.

Inside that, you are going to add another collection called `MESSAGES` that is only going to store chat conversation that happens in that chat room. This will get clear as you proceed in this section.

Start by importing the some necessary React Hooks as shown below. Also, import `firestore` to make queries to create new sub-collection, and fetch data.

```js
import React, { useState, useContext, useEffect } from 'react';
import firestore from '@react-native-firebase/firestore';
```

To get the `id` of the current chat room (_this is important_) you have to pass the `route` as a parameter to the `RoomScreen` functional component. Since, from the previous screen, a `thread` object is passed which gives the chat room id (_or thread id_) store in the Firebase collection `THREADS`. Using `route.params` you can get the whole `thread` object. This is possible because of `react-navigation`.

```js
export default function RoomScreen({ route }) {
  // ... rest of the code
  const { thread } = route.params;
}
```

Next, modify the asynchronous helper method `handleSend`. This method is used to send a message as you might have already seen in part 4.

Inside this helper method, get the text of each message send by the user. Then, create the sub collection `MESSAGES` by referencing the correct id of the current thread the user is conversing in. Using `add()` you can add anew document with an auto-generated unique id for each message inside the sub collection.

Pass on an object with fields like `text` that represents the text of each message, the timestamp it is being send or created at, and the user information (such as user's `uid`, and `email`).

```js
async function handleSend(messages) {
  const text = messages[0].text;

  firestore()
    .collection('THREADS')
    .doc(thread._id)
    .collection('MESSAGES')
    .add({
      text,
      createdAt: new Date().getTime(),
      user: {
        _id: currentUser.uid,
        email: currentUser.email
      }
    });
}
```

Go back to the simulator, create a new room, and send a message.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/684/1*Bw1kO21guUat419nn5Gd-A.gif' />

In Firebase console, you are going to notice that the inside the `THREADS` collection, a sub-collection called `MESSAGES` is created as shown below.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*88BW7XRZjeFhSrUqvaxA0A.png' />

Ignore the `latestMessage` field, we will cover that in the next section. The image below displays that the messages are being stored with correct information.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*t-vcelQcGA_HI9cvutPZ_g.png' />

## Display the latest message for each chat room on homeÂ screen

In this section, you are going to update the `THREADS` collection with a new field called `latestMessage` that you have already seen in the previous section, in Firebase console.

The advantage this field is going to give us (which we will complete later) is to show the last or the latest message send in a particular chat room, to be displayed on the home screen where a room's description field already exists. This will save the user time to glance at the last message without opening the room to see if there are any new messages or not.

To begin, all you have to do is refer the current thread using its id, then `set` an object that has field `latestMessage` with `text` and `createdAt` timestamp properties. Then pass on the second object that has a property of `merge`.

```js
async function handleSend(messages) {
  // ...

  await firestore()
    .collection('THREADS')
    .doc(thread._id)
    .set(
      {
        latestMessage: {
          text,
          createdAt: new Date().getTime()
        }
      },
      { merge: true }
    );
}
```

In Firestore, when `set` is used with `merge`, it update fields in a document or create that document if it does not exists. If you use `set` here without `merge`, it will overwrite the whole document.

## How to fetch messages from Firestore to display in chat room?

To display messages in a chat room once they send by a user, these messages have to be fetched from the Firestore sub-collection created previous sections, `MESSAGES`.

To fetch the data, let us use `useEffect` hook. [The effect hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) lets you add side-effects to functional components. In the previous versions of React and React Native, this could be done by using lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount()` and other different methods in class components. The `useEffect` hook can perform multiple side-effects such as data fetching and more in different ways.

To fetch the messages, first you have to traverse inside the current thread using its id, then the sub-collection `MESSAGES`. When traversing the sub-collection, make sure to order the messages to display them in descending order according to the time they were sent.

Then using a `querySnapshot` you can `map` the messages array from the sub collection. A Query Snapshot in Firestore contains zero objects or more objects inside an array representing the results of a query.

Create a data object that is going to contain the `id` of the document being fetched, the text of the message and its timestamp, and any other data associated with the message or in the document. The last step is required to identify that if the message is send by the user or is system generated.

In part 4 you have seen how a system generated message looks like. This means, if the message is generated when the chat room was created or not.

If the message is not system generated, that means it is send by the user. You will have to add the user's email (or any other details can be added such as user's display name)to the `data` object. Add the following snippet.

```js
async function handleSend(messages) {
  // ...

  useEffect(() => {
    const messagesListener = firestore()
      .collection('THREADS')
      .doc(thread._id)
      .collection('MESSAGES')
      .orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
      .onSnapshot(querySnapshot => {
        const messages = querySnapshot.docs.map(doc => {
          const firebaseData = doc.data();

          const data = {
            _id: doc.id,
            text: '',
            createdAt: new Date().getTime(),
            ...firebaseData
          };

          if (!firebaseData.system) {
            data.user = {
              ...firebaseData.user,
              name: firebaseData.user.email
            };
          }

          return data;
        });

        setMessages(messages);
      });

    return () => messagesListener();
  }, []);
}
```

The messages in chat room are going to be displayed as the following.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*WDL3DnVJPQPUNMIpD0NHTg.png' />

In order to make all this work, make sure to modify the following two props in return statement.

```js
<GiftedChat
      messages={messages}
      // Modify the following
      onSend={handleSend}
      user={{ _id: currentUser.uid }}
      // ...rest remains same
    />
  );
```

## How to set a system message as latest message in a chat room?

Right now the `THREADS` collection for each chat room can display the latest message sent by the user but when a thread is created, you might want to display a system, generated message to convey the same message to the user entering the chat room. To do this, open `AddRoomScreen.js` file and modify its its helper method `handleButtonPress` to add the following snippet.

First you are going to add the `latestMessage` object with its text field saying that a room is created. Do not forget to add a timestamp field along with the text field.

Second step is to add a `docRef` or a document reference to the sub-collection `MESSAGES`. Note that, at this point, when the user creates a new room, this sub-collection will be created for each chat room.

A document reference in Firestore is used to write, read or listen to a particular location or a sub-collection inside a Firestore collection.

The document or in the current case, the collection `MESSAGES` might not exist but adding this step will create the collection. This first message in a chat room is also going to be the system generated message.

```js
function handleButtonPress() {
  if (roomName.length > 0) {
    firestore()
      .collection('THREADS')
      .add({
        name: roomName,
        latestMessage: {
          text: `You have joined the room ${roomName}.`,
          createdAt: new Date().getTime()
        }
      })
      .then(docRef => {
        docRef.collection('MESSAGES').add({
          text: `You have joined the room ${roomName}.`,
          createdAt: new Date().getTime(),
          system: true
        });
        navigation.navigate('Home');
      });
  }
}
```

Now, when you create a new room through the app, here is the complete overview of how it gets reflected in Firestore.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*FqFGH5woXMLdH0MnlNLUtg.png' />

And here is the system message displayed in the new chat room.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*eGiETDWsXMKgnczQ6nAUfA.png' />

## Customizing the system message in react-native-gifted-chat

Right now the system message generated is not as appealing and conveying inside a chat room. In this short section, let us learn how to customize that in `react-native-gifted-chat`.

Start by importing `SystemMessage` component from `react-native-gifted-chat` inside `RoomScreen.js` file.

```js
import {
  GiftedChat,
  Bubble,
  Send,
  // Add this
  SystemMessage
} from 'react-native-gifted-chat';
```

Create a new helper method called `renderSystemMessage` inside the screen component with the following snippet. In the current scenario, you are going to change the background of the system message display as well as the text styles. For that you need to edit the props `wrapperStyle` and `textStyle` of `SystemMessage` component.

Do modify the `StyleSheet` object to add styles as shown below.

```js
function renderSystemMessage(props) {
  return (
    <SystemMessage
      {...props}
      wrapperStyle={styles.systemMessageWrapper}
      textStyle={styles.systemMessageText}
    />
  );
}

// appropriate styles

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // ... rest of the styles remain unchanged
  systemMessageText: {
    fontSize: 14,
    color: '#fff',
    fontWeight: 'bold'
  }
});
```

Lastly, add the prop `renderSystemMessage` to `GiftedChat` component.

```js
return (
  <GiftedChat
    // rest of the props remain same
    renderSystemMessage={renderSystemMessage}
  />
);
```

Here is the output you are going to get after this step.

## How to display latest message on home screen?

For every chat room on home screen there is description field that says a static message `Item description`. In this section let us change that to dynamically display the real-time latest message fetched from the Firestore collection.

Open `HomeScreen.js` and `orderBy()` when fetching name of chat rooms in the Effect hook. Then, when returning the documentSnapShot data, there is an object that contain fields like `_id` and `name`. Add another object as a field called `latestMessage` as shown below.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = firestore()
    .collection('THREADS')
    // add this
    .orderBy('latestMessage.createdAt', 'desc')
    .onSnapshot(querySnapshot => {
      const threads = querySnapshot.docs.map(documentSnapshot => {
        return {
          _id: documentSnapshot.id,
          name: '',
          // add this
          latestMessage: {
            text: ''
          },
          // ---
          ...documentSnapshot.data()
        };
      });

      setThreads(threads);

      if (loading) {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    });

  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

Next, go to the `List.Item` inside the `FlatList` component and modify the description field as shown below.

```js
description={item.latestMessage.text}
```

Go back to the simulator and you are going to see the latest message displayed.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/940/1*wc1bhW2LavbuiM3dw0QCXA.png' />

Try sending a new message and that is going to be the latest message displayed on the home screen for the chat room.

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/684/1*JKTyv7WO-_TOtOcHPmlfBw.gif' />

There is a benefit of ordering the chat rooms according to the latest message for each room. Now the home screen is going to display that chat room on top which received it the most recent message according the timestamp (createdAt)that is associated with the message.

## What's Next?

In the [next part](https://amanhimself.dev/blog/chat-app-with-react-native-part-6) of the series we are going to fix a small bug related of status bar styles for every screen component in the current app. This is going to be done by creating a custom hook and using `react-navigation`.
