_I haven't written a weekly note since [February](/blog/week-notes-09/) and I am trying to get back into it._

This week has been incredibly busy with a busier weekend and I am writing this late on a Sunday.

- 📝 Published a post about [avoiding version conflicts when using Vale as part of your docs tooling](/blog/vale-and-github-actions/). At my workplace, we use GitHub Actions and recently, I ran into an issue where Vale CLI broke both locally and on CI. I wrote this post as a reminder to always make sure that the version used locally (which is battle-tested) should be the same version used in the CI pipeline.
- 📝 Another post in the docs-as-code (I have three now, can I call it series?). This time it's an explanation about disabling the scope inside a Vale CLI rule file for [front matter](/blog/front-matter-scope-in-vale/).
- It took some courage, but I finally started sharing what I wrote on this blog with my "social" network. I shared the docs-as-code posts that I've written recently about Vale. And yes, I did end up calling it a series.
- 📝 I also worked on two draft posts in the realms of React Native. I need to polish them more before publishing.
- 📖 I've subscribed to Readwise Reader app and all my TBR list living inside Chrome tabs for last six months is now inside the Reader app's inbox.
- 📚This month I have read a three fiction books (they were great companions when I was traveling earlier). I have managed to finish The 30-Day burnout fix by Janessa Rhoades.
