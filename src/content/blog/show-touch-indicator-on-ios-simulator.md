Sometimes it is necessary to highlight a single touch event on the iOS simulator's screen and show the tap that registers it. For example, this is useful when recording a video or a [gif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) using the simulator.

The iOS simulator comes with a pre-configured list of settings, including to display the touch indicator. However, sometimes, it is hard to find them.

## Enable Touch Indicator on iOS simulator

To enable the touch indicator, open the terminal window and run the following command:

```shell
defaults write com.apple.iphonesimulator ShowSingleTouches 1
```

It accepts a boolean value of `1`.

After running the command, if the iOS simulator is already running, close and restart it.

To test it out, open the simulator and tap on the screen.

```
