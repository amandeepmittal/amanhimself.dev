Happy February! I honestly don't know where January went.

- I was able to make more progress this week with the llms.txt project. Other tasks did suffer because of that.
- Did some more style changes to the blog this week by fixing some theme issues. Good thing about using Astro it that it [includes Shiki](/blog/new-blog-theme-and-colors/) out of the box.
- I had a bad migraine episode which lasted for almost two days.
- Made progress on a hobby project that I started last month.

## Writing

- One new post on the new blog theme.

## Reading

- Completed 5 volumes of the Bakuman, a manga about a manga artist's journey.
