If you use your macOS for Python projects, especially for AI tools like Stable Diffusion WebUI or Open Web UI, you likely find it frustrating that macOS ships with a `python3` default version. Sometimes, this version can be outdated or locked down. One project may require Python 3.11, while another requires 3.9.

For example, at the time of writing the guide, the default Python version on my machine is:

```shell
python3 —version

# Output
Python 3.13.3
```

However, considering the Stable Diffusion Web UI's requirements, it is recommended to install Python 3.10 because `torch`, a framework for building deep learning models, yet isn't supported in newer versions.

This is where using `conda` to manage packages and environments in Python projects comes in handy. It helps to install, manage, and update packages from Anaconda and other repositories, removing that extra layer of complexity.

In this guide, I'll share installation steps to install `conda` using [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), which is a lightweight, community driven `conda` installer. It does not install those extra dependencies when installing it. Whether you're setting up Stable Diffusion WebUI for the first time or spinning up Open WebUI for local AI chat, you'll have clean, reproducible environments that just work.

## Download the shell script

Miniforge recommends downloading `conda` using a shell script for Apple Silicon machines.

Visit https://conda-forge.org/download/.
Download the latest version by clicking the macOS tile for `arm64 (Apple Silicon)`.

Once you have downloaded it, in your terminal, run the script using `sh`:

```shell
sh /Users/username/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
```

This will bring up the installation steps, such as reviewing the license and agreeing to it. Once you accept the license terms and accept the location to install it (I choose the default location so it installs under the `username` directory).

## Activate conda's base environment

To activate conda's base environment that will use the default Python version, you need to add the following in your shell's source script. Since I use zsh shell, I added the following at the end of my `.zshrc` file:

```shell
################ END OF FILE configs ################

# conda

eval "$(/Users/username/miniforge3/bin/conda shell.zsh hook)"
```

Then, either restart the terminal or run `source .zshrc`.

## Verify installation

To verify installation, I am using a new terminal window. I run the following commands:

```shell
conda —version

# Output
conda 25.3.0

python —version

# Output
Python 3.12.10
```

 
Python `3.12.10` is the default version conda is using on my machine. This Python version is installed separately from the one pre-installed on macOS or installed via homebrew before.

At any time, you can also run `which python` to check the location of the Python's executable file:

```shell
which python
/Users/username/miniforge3/bin/python
(base)
```

## New environment with conda

To create a new environment and use a specific Python version, run the command:

```shell
conda create —name py39
```

This command will create a new environment and will also output the environment location on your machine:

```shell
environment location: /Users/username/miniforge3/envs/py39
```

Any environment created goes inside the `miniforge3/envs/` directory.

To use this new environment, you need to activate it first by using the `activate` option:

```shell
conda activate py39
```

Once it is activated, run the command to install the Python version you want in your project's environment:

```shell
conda install python=3.9
```

Then, you can run the version verification command to check which version of Python is used in this environment:

```shell
python --version

# Output
Python 3.9.23
```

## Deactivate an environment

To deactivate an environment, you can run:

```shell
conda deactivate
```

After running this command, you will be back into the conda's base environment, which was created by default.
