There is an element of confusion when it comes to use FontAwesome in an Ionic Application. To include this fonts library in Ionic needs a bit of configuration and this step by step guide will provide just that.

### Bootstrap an Ionic Application

Create a new Ionic application or you can follow these steps to include FontAwesome in your Ionic application. Nothing will break down.

```shell
$ ionic start ionic-use-fontawesome
```

Now, install the FontAwesome package from `npm` and save it in the app's dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install font-awesome --save
```

Type the above in the root folder of your app. This will add the `font-awesome` folder under `node_modules`. The `--save` option will include the package inside the dependencies section of `package.json` file.

### Include the fonts

Now wander to the `src/index.html` file and add the following `link` tag just above `build/main.css`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/font-awesome.min.css" />
<link href="build/main.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### Add a Custom Copy Script

Ionic includes a copy script file that is called during the build process when the command `ionic serve` executes and it is responsible for moving specific and required resources from `node_modules` to the `www` folder such as ionicons.

The location of this script file is under `node_modules` folder:

Copy this file and paste in inside a new directory called `config` under the root directory of your Ionic application. Open the file and add fontawesome entries at the bottom of this file.

```js
copyFontawesomeFonts: {
    src: ['{{ROOT}}/node_modules/font-awesome/fonts/**/*'],
    dest: '{{WWW}}/assets/fonts'
  },
  copyFontawesomeCss: {
    src: ['{{ROOT}}/node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css'],
    dest: '{{WWW}}/assets/css'
  }
```

### Include Custom Copy Script in package.json

We must include this custom script inside our `package.json` file to override the one where we copied the original file from. Open the `package.json` file and add this json code:

```json
"config": {
    "ionic_copy": "./config/copy.config.js"
  }
```

That’s it in the configuration part.

### Use FontAwesome

To implement FontAwesome in this or any Ionic application after the above configuration, we try adding some fonts on our pre-generated home page.

```html
<ion-header>
  <ion-navbar color="secondary">
    <ion-title> FontAwesome Icons </ion-title>
  </ion-navbar>
</ion-header>

<ion-content padding>
  <ion-list>
    <ion-item>
      <i class="fa fa-battery-empty" style="color: red;"></i> Battery Level
      Empty
    </ion-item>
    <ion-item> <i class="fa fa-battery-1"></i> Battery Level 1 </ion-item>
    <ion-item> <i class="fa fa-battery-2"></i> Battery Level 2 </ion-item>
    <ion-item> <i class="fa fa-battery-3"></i> Battery Level 3 </ion-item>
    <ion-item>
      <i class="fa fa-battery-4" style="color: green;"></i> Battery Level 4
    </ion-item>
  </ion-list>
</ion-content>
```

There are more than 675 icons available in FontAwesome and I think a combination of both Ionicons and FontAwesome will be enough for some the applications out there. You can even style them, change their `font-size` and color as per your needs.
