Uploading Files might seem a task that needs to be conquered especially if you are getting into web development. In this tutorial, simple AJAX based file uploads using Reactjs on front-end and Node.js back-end. This is easy to accomplish with the following technologies since the whole source code will be in one language, JavaScript. In this example, to demonstrate for connecting a Reactjs application with Node.js backend, we will be making the use of a simple file upload example. The topics we will be covering are going to be:

- Setting up a Back-end of our app using `express-generator`
- Using `create-react-app` to scaffold a front-end Reactjs app
- Using `axios` for cross-origin API calls
- Handling POST requests on our server
- Using `express-fileupload`, a promise based library
- Lastly, making a connection between Reactjs and Node.js

### Getting Started

We will be starting without back-end first. We will write a server application with necessary configurations required to accept cross-origin requests and uploading files. First, we need to install `express-generator` which is the official and quickest way to start with an Express back-end application.

```shell
npm install -g express-generator
```

We will install this module globally from our terminal. After installing this global `npm` module, we have an instance of it named `express` to generate our project structure.

```shell
mkdir fileupload-example
express server
cd server
```

When changing the current directory to the project `express` command just scaffolded, we can observe the following structure and files:

To run this backend server on default configuration, we have to install the dependencies mentioned in `package.json` first.

```js
npm install
npm start
```

Express-generator comes with following dependencies. Some of them are essential to use such as `morgan` and `body-parser` and some we can leave out for this project.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "~1.18.2",
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.3",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "express": "~4.15.5",
    "jade": "~1.11.0",
    "morgan": "~1.9.0",
    "serve-favicon": "~2.4.5"
  }
```

I will be adding two more packages for our configurable back-end application to behave in the way we want to.

```shell
npm install --save cors express-fileupload
```

`cors` provide a middleware function for Express applications to enable various Cross-Origin Resource Sharing options. CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (in our case, API or AJAX requests) on a web page from another domain. It helps a browser and a server to communicate and can be hosted on separate domains. You will understand it more when you will see it in action.

The other module, `express-fileupload` is a bare minimum express middleware function for uploading files. The advantages it has it that it has support for Promises and can handle multiple file uploads.

With these two important packages added as dependencies in our project, we can now start by modifying the default Express back-end in `app.js` file.

```js
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const favicon = require('serve-favicon');
const logger = require('morgan');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors'); // addition we make
const fileUpload = require('express-fileupload'); //addition we make

const index = require('./routes/index');
const users = require('./routes/users');

const app = express();

// view engine setup
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'jade');

// uncomment after placing your favicon in /public
//app.use(favicon(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'favicon.ico')));
app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(cookieParser());

// Use CORS and File Upload modules here
app.use(cors());
app.use(fileUpload());

app.use('/public', express.static(__dirname + '/public'));

app.use('/', index);

// catch 404 and forward to error handler
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  const err = new Error('Not Found');
  err.status = 404;
  next(err);
});

// error handler
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  // set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};

  // render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render('error');
});

module.exports = app;
```

In the above code, you would notice that we made some additions. The first addition we did is to import packages `cors` and `express-fileupload` in `app.js` after other dependencies are loaded.

```js
const cors = require('cors'); // addition we make
const fileUpload = require('express-fileupload'); //addition we make
```

Then just after other middleware functions, we will instantiate these two newly imported packages.

```js
// Use CORS and File Upload modules here
app.use(cors());
app.use(fileUpload());
```

Also, we need to allow data coming from a form. For this, we have to enable `urlencoded` options of `body-parser` module and specify a path as to store the image file coming from the client.

```js
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// below, also change this to
app.use('/public', express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
```

With this, we can see if our server is working correctly by running:

```shell
npm start
```

If you get the screen below by navigation on port `http://localhost:3000`, it means that our server is running.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Tgeuf8qKcqzzwfSZ.png' />

Before we move to generate our front-end application, we need to change to port for our backend since front-end application generated using `create-react-app` will also be running on port `3000`. Open `bin/www` file and edit:

```js
/**
 * Get port from environment and store in Express.
 */

// 3000 by default, we change it to 4000

var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '4000');
app.set('port', port);
```

### Setting up Front-end

`create-react-app` is another command line utility that to generate a default Reactjs front-end application.

```shell
create-react-app node-react-fileupload-front-end
```

We will also install the required library we are going to use for making API calls to our backend server.

```shell
yarn add axios
```

`index.js` is the starting point of our application in the `src/` directory. It registers the render function using `ReactDOM.render()` by mounting `App` component. Components are the building blocks in any Reactjs application. This `App` component comes from `src/App.js`. We will be editing this file in our front-end source code.

### File UploadÂ Form

We will be using the HTML `form` element that has an input which provides access to the value, that is the file, using `refs`. `Ref` is a special attribute that can be attached to any component in React. It takes a callback function and this callback will be executed immediately after the component is mounted. It can be also be used on an HTML element and the callback function associated will receive the DOM element as the argument. This way, `ref` can be used to store a reference for that DOM element. That is exactly what we are going to do.

```js
class App extends Component {
  // We will add this part later

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>FileUpload</h1>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleUploadImage}>
          <div>
            <input
              ref={ref => {
                this.uploadInput = ref;
              }}
              type="file"
            />
          </div>
          <br />
          <div>
            <input
              ref={ref => {
                this.fileName = ref;
              }}
              type="text"
              placeholder="Enter the desired name of file"
            />
          </div>
          <br />
          <div>
            <button>Upload</button>
          </div>
          <hr />
          <p>Uploaded Image:</p>
          <img src={this.state.imageURL} alt="img" />
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

The `input` element must have the `type="file"` otherwise it would not be able to recognize what type we are using it for. It is similar to the values like `email`, `password`, etc.

The `handleUploadImage` method will take care of the API calls that we need to request to the server. If that call is successful, the local state of our React application will be set to let the user know that the upload was successful. Inside this function, to make the API call, we will be using `axios` library we installed when setting up our front end app.

```js
constructor(props) {
		super(props);

		this.state = {
			imageURL: ''
		};

		this.handleUploadImage = this.handleUploadImage.bind(this);
	}

	handleUploadImage(ev) {
		ev.preventDefault();

		const data = new FormData();
		data.append('file', this.uploadInput.files[0]);
		data.append('filename', this.fileName.value);

		fetch('http://localhost:4000/upload', {
			method: 'POST',
			body: data
		}).then(response => {
			response.json().then(body => {
				this.setState({ imageURL: `http://localhost:4000/${body.file}` });
			});
		});
	}
```

The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using XMLHttpRequest. It is primarily intended for use in sending form data but can be used independently from forms in order to transmit keyed data. To build a FormData object, instantiating it then appending fields to it by calling its `append()` method like we did above.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Xa5qBk-hqFkJsTIW.png' />

Since we are not using any styling, our form looks bare minimum and ugly. But you can go ahead and make it look more professional. For brevity, I am going to keep things simple. I recommend you to always enter a file uname, other wise it will store the file on the with `undefined.jpg` name.

### Updating the server to handle AJAXÂ Request

Right now, we do not have in our server code to handle the `POST` request React app makes a request to. We will add the route in our `app.js` in our Express application where the default route is defined.

```js
app.post('/upload', (req, res, next) => {
  // console.log(req);
  let imageFile = req.files.file;

  imageFile.mv(`${__dirname}/public/${req.body.filename}.jpg`, err => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(500).send(err);
    }

    res.json({ file: `public/${req.body.filename}.jpg` });
    console.log(res.json);
  });
});
```

```shell
npm start
```

This route gets triggered when a request is made to `/upload/`. The callback associated using the route contain `req`, `res` objects and access to `next`, a standard way of defining a middleware function in an Express application. The `req` object has the file and the filename that was uploaded during form submission from the client application. If any error occurs, we return the 500 server error code. Otherwise we return the path to the actual file and console the `response` object to check if everything is work as we expect it.

`.mv` file is promise-based and provided to us by the `express-fileupload` package we installed earlier. Try uploading an image file from the client now. Make sure both the client and server are running from different terminal tabs at this point. If you get a success message like this in your terminal:

```shell
POST /upload 200 98.487 ms - 25
GET /public/abc.jpg 200 6.231 ms - 60775
```

At the same time, the client is requesting to view the file on the front-end with a `GET` HTTP method. That means the route `/upload` from the browser is successfully called and everything is working fine. Once the file is uploaded on the server and it will be sent back to the client to reflect that the user has successfully uploaded the file.
