Creating a better user experience is one of the most important aspects of any application. This is where animations in mobile applications come into play. Animations are an important part of your mobile application.

Fortunately, for React Native developers, there is recommended a way to create desirable user experiences. It can be achieved through [Animated API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html). For most use cases Animated API provides the best use case to design and create fluid animations.

In this tutorial, you are going to take dive deep in creating a custom modal and animated it on a button click. This is the final result we looking to achieve in a React Native application.

## Prerequisites

Here is a complete list of plugins, packages, and tools that youâ€™re going to need in order to follow along.

- Nodejs >= `v8.x.x` installed along with npm/yarn.
- `watchman`, the file change watcher for React Native projects.
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/) >= `v2.19.4`.

To get started create a new project using `expo-cli` toolchain with the following set of commands. The first command will create a new project directory. Make sure you are inside the project when running the application in a simulator environment or a real device.

```shell
# create a new bare project
expo-cli init rn-animations

# navigate inside the directory
cd rn-animations

# to start the project
yarn start
```

We are using `yarn` to kickstart the app but you are most welcome to use npm or npm scrips or use Expo CLI tool command: `expo start`. This way you can verify that the project has been created successfully.

Next step is to install different dependencies or libraries that our little demo project is going to depend. Run the below command from a terminal window.

```shell
yarn add redux react-redux styled-components @expo/vector-icons
```

After installing these dependencies, this is how `package.json` file looks like.

```json
{
  "main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "expo start",
    "android": "expo start --android",
    "ios": "expo start --ios",
    "web": "expo start --web",
    "eject": "expo eject"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@expo/vector-icons": "^10.0.2",
    "expo": "^33.0.0",
    "react": "16.8.3",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.6",
    "react-native": "https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-33.0.0.tar.gz",
    "react-native-web": "^0.11.4",
    "react-redux": "^7.0.3",
    "redux": "^4.0.1",
    "styled-components": "^4.3.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-preset-expo": "^5.1.1"
  },
  "private": true
}
```

## Setup up Screens

Create two screens inside a new directory called `screens/`. One is going to be the home screen for the app and the main UI point. The second screen is going to be a normal screen but will behave like a custom modal in terms of UI behavior. You can name them whatever you like but make sure to remember those names.

Here is the initial snippet of `screens/HomeScreen.js`.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

class HomeScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <ButtonText>Open Modal</ButtonText>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const ButtonText = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 600;
`;

export default HomeScreen;
```

The above snippet is using `styled-components` to define new UI elements using React Native API. For more information on to read on how to integrate `styled-components` and its advantage in a React Native app, please go through this [link](https://medium.com/swlh/using-styled-components-with-react-native-de645fcf4787).

For `CustomModal.js`:

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

class CustomModal extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Text>CustomModal</Text>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const Text = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 600;
`;

export default CustomModal;
```

Now, let us import the `HomeScreen` component inside `App.js`. This component is going to be the entry point of our app.

```js
import React from 'react';

import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen';

export default function App() {
  return <HomeScreen />;
}
```

On running the application using `yarn start` you will get the following result. The header has a breakthrough line indicates that the stack navigator has been integrated into our app.

## Setting up Redux

In this section, let us create a simple reducer for Redux state management library. It might be that redux as a library is overkill for the purpose of this tutorial, so if you don't want to use it, please find a way that works for you. Also, I am not going to get into details of how you should manage reducers and actions right now. That said, first create a reducer inside a new file called `reducers/index.js` with an initial state.

```js
const initialState = {
  action: ''
};

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'OPEN_MODAL':
      return { ...state, action: 'openModal' };
    case 'CLOSE_MODAL':
      return { ...state, action: 'closeModal' };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default reducer;
```

Since the `redux` and `react-redux` dependencies are already installed, open `App.js` file and inside write the code to hook a store provider for redux to manage global state in the app.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen';
import reducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(reducer);

const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <HomeScreen />
  </Provider>
);

export default App;
```

The redux setup is complete. Let us move on to the next section where the real thing starts.

## Creating an animated Custom Modal

Even though we are creating this custom modal as a screen, you can always use this as a re-usable component. Open `CustomModel.js` file and add the following snippet of code.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

class CustomModal extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Header />
        <Body />
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  position: absolute;
  background: white;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 100;
`;

const Header = styled.View`
  background: #333;
  height: 150px;
`;

const Body = styled.View`
  background: #eaeaea;
  height: 900px;
`;

export default CustomModal;
```

The above component is simple. It contains three react native views. On the `Container` we are using the CSS property `position: absolute`. The `z-index` will allow the modal to appear on the top of the `HomeScreen` component. The `Header` and the `Body` are subviews with fixed `height`.

In order to see this in action, open `HomeScreen.js` and import it.

```js
// ...
import CustomModal from './CustomModal';

class HomeScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <CustomModal />
        <ButtonText>Open Modal</ButtonText>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

// ...
```

You will get the following result in your simulator.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rIrz_kLxluX_9Pll7tj-Vg.png' />

Great! Now that we can see the Custom Model on the screen, let us start applying some animations. To apply animations in this demo application, we will be using `Animated` API from React Native. You do not have to install anything rather than import the API from React Native core. Open `CustomModel.js` and modify it. In the below snippet, also define an initial state.

This initial state value defines an Animated `top` value to push model up and down.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { Animated } from 'react-native';

class CustomModal extends React.Component {
  state = {
    top: new Animated.Value(900)
  };
  render() {
    return (
      <AnimatedContainer style={{ top: this.state.top }}>
        <Header />
        <Body />
      </AnimatedContainer>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  position: absolute;
  background: white;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 100;
`;

const AnimatedContainer = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Container);

const Header = styled.View`
  background: #333;
  height: 150px;
`;

const Body = styled.View`
  background: #eaeaea;
  height: 900px;
`;

export default CustomModal;
```

Right now, the initial top value is receiving an Animated value of `900`. The syntax `Animated.Value()` is used to bind style properties such as we are using with `AnimatedContainer`. In order to perform animations, the component or the `View` has to be Animated, thus, you can `Animated.createAnimatedComponent()` to transform a basic `View` an Animated one.

Next, define a custom method called `toggleModal` before the render function. This function will handle the animations to open and close the modal. So far, it is:

```js
componentDidMount() {
        this.toggleModal()
    }

toggleModal = () => {
    Animated.spring(this.state.top, {
        toValue: 174
    }).start()
}
```

In the above snippet, we are using spring animations using `Animated.spring()` method. This is used to configure animations based on the analytical values to create a simple spring model based on physics. To read more about this method, take a look at this [link](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated#spring) in official React Native documentation. The `toValue` is passed as the second parameter. Lastly, to start an animation, you need to call the method `.start()`.

To trigger this animation on the first render of the component `CustomModal`, we are using React's lifecycle method `componentDidMount()`.

You will get the following result.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Nl3yw5Rgy4Wo3NnBGpvSbg.gif' />

We need to add a button to close the modal. Let us add the styles and view for the close button on the modal. Create a `CloseView` component with `styled-components` library inside a `TouchableOpacity` button. Also, for the close icon, we are going to use `@expo/vector-icons` library.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { Animated, TouchableOpacity, Dimensions } from 'react-native';
import * as Icon from '@expo/vector-icons';

const screenHeight = Dimensions.get('window').height;

class CustomModal extends React.Component {
  state = {
    top: new Animated.Value(screenHeight)
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    this.toggleModal();
  }

  toggleModal = () => {
    Animated.spring(this.state.top, {
      toValue: 174
    }).start();
  };

  closeModal = () => {
    Animated.spring(this.state.top, {
      toValue: screenHeight
    }).start();
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <AnimatedContainer style={{ top: this.state.top }}>
        <Header />
        <TouchableOpacity
          onPress={this.closeModal}
          style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 120,
            left: '50%',
            marginLeft: -22,
            zIndex: 1
          }}
        >
          <CloseView style={{ elevation: 10 }}>
            <Icon.Ionicons name="ios-close" size={44} color="blue" />
          </CloseView>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <Body />
      </AnimatedContainer>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  position: absolute;
  background: white;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 100;
`;

const AnimatedContainer = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Container);

const Header = styled.View`
  background: #333;
  height: 150px;
`;

const Body = styled.View`
  background: #eaeaea;
  height: ${screenHeight};
`;

const CloseView = styled.View`
  width: 44px;
  height: 44px;
  border-radius: 22px;
  background: white;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
`;

export default CustomModal;
```

To calculate the height of a screen's device, in the above snippet, start by importing `Dimensions` API. React Native uses Dots Per Inch (DPI) to measure the size (_width and height_) of a device's screen. `Dimensions.get("window").height` allows to gather the screen height. We then use this `screenHeight` variable in three places. First, the initial state which was before had a static value of `900` is now able to adapt for different devices.

Second, to close the modal or inside `closeModal()` method. In the `toggleModal` function we are setting a custom to value of `174` which leaves a partial view of the `HomeScreen` in the background. If you set this value to `0`, the custom modal will cover the whole screen. To close the modal is setting this value to default screen's height. The `TouchableOpacity` that wraps the close button invokes the method `closeModal`.

The third place where the variable `screenHeight` are the styles of the view container: `Body`. Please note that box-shadow will not work on Android devices. If you still want to give the close button a shadow, use `elevation` property as inline styles to `CloseView`.

You will get the following result in your simulator device.

## Integrating Redux to Modal

In this section, you are going to use Redux to manage the state of opening and closing the modal. We have already defined the reducers and actions to serve this purpose. Open `CustomModal.js` and import the `connect` High Order Function `react-redux` library. After that, create two new functions that are somewhat boilerplate code when using a redux in any React or React Native application. These functions are called: `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`.

```js
// ...
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  return { action: state.action };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    closeModal: () =>
      dispatch({
        type: 'CLOSE_MODAL'
      })
  };
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(CustomModal);
```

Next, let us merge the business logic to trigger animations for opening and closing the modal inside the same `toggleModal` function. The below snippet uses `if` statements to track the right action coming from the global state.

```js
toggleModal = () => {
  if (this.props.action === 'openModal') {
    Animated.spring(this.state.top, {
      toValue: 174
    }).start();
  }
  if (this.props.action === 'closeModal') {
    Animated.spring(this.state.top, {
      toValue: screenHeight
    }).start();
  }
};
```

Also, change the value for `onPress` attribute at the `TouchableOpacity` to `onPress={this.props.closeMenu}`. Lastly, `componentDidMount()` method is going to call `toggleModal()` only on the initial render which means it is going to be called only once. To resolve this, let us use `componentDidUpdate()`. This lifecycle method triggers every time there is a new state or change in props.

```js
componentDidUpdate() {
        this.toggleModal()
    }
```

## Integrating Custom Modal to HomeScreen

Since the initial state at the application level right now is empty, you are not going to see the modal trigger, by itself, when you refresh the Expo app. This serves the purpose of keeping the default behavior of the modal to be closed. But top open this custom modal, we are going to add a button on the `HomeScreen` to activate it.

Open `HomeScreen.js` and connect it to the redux state like below.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import CustomModal from './CustomModal';

class HomeScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <CustomModal />
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={this.props.openModal}>
          <ButtonText>Open Modal</ButtonText>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const ButtonText = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 600;
`;

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  return { action: state.action };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    openModal: () =>
      dispatch({
        type: 'OPEN_MODAL'
      })
  };
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(HomeScreen);
```

Click the button `Open Modal` on the UI screen and you will get similar results as follows.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4RgkT_Rmn2gqO-6Q99wXHA.gif' />

_Congratulations! You have just created a custom model that is animated and integrated it from another screen_. You can end this tutorial right here if it serves the purpose or the as the title suggests. Though, if you want to continue, let us add some animations to the HomeScreen to create a pleasing UI in the next section.

## Animating HomeScreen

In the `HomeScreen` component we are going to import quite a few APIs from React Native. The result we are trying to achieve is as follows. It will be easier for you to view what we want to happen to understand the code in this section.

<img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*F9LUoINWB7uRjTYX5FCDdg.gif' />

Now that you have seen that let us first go through what are we going to import from `react-native`.

```js
// ...
import {
  TouchableOpacity,
  StatusBar,
  Animated,
  Easing,
  Platform
} from 'react-native';
```

In the above demo, we are switching between status bar's color from dark to light when the modal opens, we are going to use `StatusBar` inside `componentDidMount()`.

```js
    componentDidMount() {
        StatusBar.setBarStyle("dark-content", true)

        if (Platform.OS == "android") {
            StatusBar.setBarStyle("light-content", true)
        }
    }
```

Next, we define an initial state to manage Animations with two properties, `scale` and `opacity`.

```js
state = {
  scale: new Animated.Value(1),
  opacity: new Animated.Value(1)
};
```

The create a `toggleModal` method where most of the things are happening. It gets triggered by `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle method just like in the `CustomModal` component.

```js
componentDidUpdate() {
        this.toggleModal()
    }

    toggleModal = () => {
        if (this.props.action === "openModal") {
            Animated.timing(this.state.scale, {
                toValue: 0.9,
                duration: 300,
                easing: Easing.in()
            }).start()
            Animated.spring(this.state.opacity, {
                toValue: 0.5
            }).start()

            StatusBar.setBarStyle("light-content", true)
        }

        if (this.props.action === "closeModal") {
            Animated.timing(this.state.scale, {
                toValue: 1,
                duration: 300,
                easing: Easing.in()
            }).start()
            Animated.spring(this.state.opacity, {
                toValue: 1
            }).start()

            StatusBar.setBarStyle("dark-content", true)
        }
    }
```

To trigger the effect `HomeScreen` shrinking in the background when the modal opens, is achieved by using `Animated.timing()`. This method maps time range to an `easing` value. This `easing` value triggers the `Easing` module from react native core. This module implements common visualization motions such as bounce, elastic, in (_which we are using_) and out, cubic, sin, back, ease, linear, quad, inout and many more. To get complete information about Easing, please refer to the docs [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/easing).

The `Animated.timing()` has a default value of `500` milliseconds. We are changing it to `300`.

To create partial opacity when the home screen shrinks in the background, we are again using spring animations. Depending on whether the modal is being opened or closed, the style of the `StatusBar` is being changed by calling the `StatusBar.setBarStyle()` method.

Here is the complete code for `HomeScreen.js` file.

```js
import React from 'react';
import {
  TouchableOpacity,
  StatusBar,
  Animated,
  Easing,
  Platform
} from 'react-native';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import CustomModal from './CustomModal';

class HomeScreen extends React.Component {
  state = {
    scale: new Animated.Value(1),
    opacity: new Animated.Value(1)
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    StatusBar.setBarStyle('dark-content', true);

    if (Platform.OS == 'android') {
      StatusBar.setBarStyle('light-content', true);
    }
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    this.toggleModal();
  }

  toggleModal = () => {
    if (this.props.action === 'openModal') {
      Animated.timing(this.state.scale, {
        toValue: 0.9,
        duration: 300,
        easing: Easing.in()
      }).start();
      Animated.spring(this.state.opacity, {
        toValue: 0.5
      }).start();

      StatusBar.setBarStyle('light-content', true);
    }

    if (this.props.action === 'closeModal') {
      Animated.timing(this.state.scale, {
        toValue: 1,
        duration: 300,
        easing: Easing.in()
      }).start();
      Animated.spring(this.state.opacity, {
        toValue: 1
      }).start();
      StatusBar.setBarStyle('dark-content', true);
    }
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <RootView>
        <CustomModal />
        <AnimatedContainer
          style={{
            transform: [{ scale: this.state.scale }],
            opacity: this.state.opacity
          }}
        >
          <TouchableOpacity onPress={this.props.openModal}>
            <ButtonText>Open Modal</ButtonText>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </AnimatedContainer>
      </RootView>
    );
  }
}

const RootView = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background: black;
`;

const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  background: white;
  border-top-left-radius: 10px;
  border-top-right-radius: 10px;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;

const AnimatedContainer = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Container);

const ButtonText = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 600;
`;

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  return { action: state.action };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    openModal: () =>
      dispatch({
        type: 'OPEN_MODAL'
      })
  };
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(HomeScreen);
```

In the above snippet, do take note of `RootView`. We are also converting the good old `Container` into an Animated view.

## Conclusion

This completes this tutorial about creating animated custom modal to provide a pleasant user experience in your react native application. You learned how to use the animated library and some of its methods such as `spring`, `timing` along with `Easing` module. With the help of redux to manage state, you created a custom modal UI.
