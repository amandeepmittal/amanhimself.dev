Trying out a slightly new format for weekly notes this week.

- The weather was primarily warm during the daytime; I suspect the summer will be here in no time.
- 📝 I [shared](https://amanhimself.dev/blog/dual-shiki-themes-with-astro/) how easy it is to set up dual Shiki themes for code blocks in an Astro blog. This is also something I implemented on my blog recently.
- 📚 Started reading Good Habits, Bad Habits by Wendy Wood.
- 🏋️ Only 3 days this week.
- 👾 Started playing Octopath Traveller 2. This is my first JRPG. I like this game. The graphics are extraordinarily amazing! The in-game battle mechanics always have something new to offer, and there is so much to offer. The only thing I am struggling with so far is what to do with townsfolk when, as an MC, you visit a new town.
- 🔗 Blogroll (post(s) I have been reading this week)
  - I loved reading [My Obsidian Note-Taking Workflow](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/obsidian-note-taking-workflow/) by Simon Späti on his blog. He explains how he uses PARA and Zettelkasten together while keeping things in his workflow simple and efficient so that he can continue taking notes. There is also a focus on everything being based on Plaintext files and being Local First, which is why I [prefer using Obsidian myself](/tags/obsidian/).
