I have seen webrings on blogs I usually read. I think they are an amazing way to discover new blogs within the community. However, I had never indulged previously to add one to my blog.

Recently, I read about [Static Quest](https://static.quest/) on [Clayton Errington's blog](https://claytonerrington.com/blog/static-quest/). I am a huge fan of Clayton's [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge, and the blogs I've come across through his challenge are some of the most interesting blogs I've visited.

I think becoming a part of something like a webring for static websites is a great way to support the indie web. It is also a great way to get exposure for my blog and connect with other static site enthusiasts who use SSG engines to maintain their blogs.

So, I decided to take the plunge and add the Static Quest webring to my blog. Who knows? Maybe we'll discover each other's blogs through the ring!
