First full-blown week of work after winter holidays in the USA.

- Maintained my first work routine for the first half of the week. Due to not sleeping enough, I missed the workout for the next 3 days.
- Experimented creating an interactive diagram using the React Flow library for docs work. Things got a bit complicated, but I like the outcome so far.
- Going to look at adding hidden but viewable side-quests next week.
- Started doodling. I did end up drawing a lighthouse.
- Created a mini-game clone in React Native with the help of Claude. Used it mostly to rectify logic and generate sprites. I am fascinated by how Claude can help with tasks that I could spend endless hours on the internet.

## Writing

- Not much writing outside work. No new drafts.

## Reading

- Completed Every Page is Page One by Mark Baker. Started this at the end of 2024. It was a heavy read with lots of information. Learned about a bottom-up approach for topic-based writing and presenting documentation to the end user.
- Completed two short graphic novels.
- Completed How to Take Smart Notes by SÃ¶nke Ahrens. I'm surprised that this book is so approachable and has a perfect length without any repetition or time wasting. I learned about fleeting, literature, and permanent notes while maintaining a Zettelkasten.
