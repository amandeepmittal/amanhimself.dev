Transitions in mobile applications provide design continuity. This continuity is provided by connecting common elements from one view to the next while navigating in the app. This tutorial is going to provide a guide for you who is a React Native developer and is able to create such interfaces and make sure they are tangible.

Source code is available at this [GitHub repo.](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/react-native-examples/tree/master/shared-element-transitions)

## What are shared elements transition?

Transitions between different views or activities involve enter and exit transitions that animate the entire view hierarchies independent of each other. There are times when two different views in continuity have common elements. Providing a way to transit these common elements from one view to the second view and back, emphasizes the continuity between transitions. The nature of these transitions maintain focus for the end-users on the content and provides a seamless experience. A shared element transition determines how two different views share one or elements to maintain the focus and experience.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, please make sure to have the following installed on a local environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >= 12.x.x installed
- Access to one package manager such as npm or yarn or npx
- [expo-cli](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli) installed, or use npx

Do note that to demonstrate Iâ€™ll be using an iOS simulator. If you prefer to use an Android device or an emulator, the code snippets shared in this post will run the same.

## Install shared element transition libraries

To get started, let's create a new React Native project using `expo-cli`. From a terminal window, execute the command below and then navigate inside the newly created project directory. After navigating, install the libraries that are required in order to create shared element transitions. Let's use `react-navigation` from one screen to another using a stack navigation pattern.

To install the React Navigation library, please take a look at the [following instructions](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) from the official documentation. These dependencies change with time.

```shell
npx expo init shared-element-transitions

cd shared-element-transitions

yarn add @react-navigation/native react-native-animatable

expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view

yarn add react-native-shared-element react-navigation-shared-element@next
```

After installing these libraries, let's checkout how to run the Expo app. From the terminal, run the `yarn start` command to trigger a build for the Expo app. Then depending on the simulator or the device, please select the correct option from the terminal prompt. For example, to run this app in its initial state on an iOS simulator, press `i`.

Here is how the output on an iOS simulator is shown:

This output verifies that the Expo app is up and running.

## Create a home screen

The transition in this example app is going to be between a home screen and a details screen. The home screen is going to be a scrollable list of images and some data. I am going to use a set of the mock data array. You are free to use whatever data you might want to try out. Without bothering about the data set, you can use the mock data. Create a new directory called `config/` and inside it create a new file called `data.js` with the following array and objects:

```js
export const data = [
  {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Manarola, Italy',
    description: 'The Cliffs of Cinque Terre',
    image_url:
      'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516483638261-f4dbaf036963?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=633&q=80',
    iconName: 'location-pin'
  },

  {
    id: '2',
    title: 'Venezia, Italy',
    description: 'Rialto Bridge, Venezia, Italy',
    image_url:
      'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523906834658-6e24ef2386f9?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=630&q=80',
    iconName: 'location-pin'
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    title: 'Prague, Czechia',
    description: 'Tram in Prague',
    image_url:
      'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513805959324-96eb66ca8713?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=634&q=80',
    iconName: 'location-pin'
  }
];
```

After that create a new directory called `screens/` where the two app screens are going to live. Create a file inside it called `HomeScreen.js` and import the following statements.

```js
import React from 'react';
import {
  ScrollView,
  Text,
  View,
  TouchableOpacity,
  Image,
  Dimensions
} from 'react-native';
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import { SimpleLineIcons } from '@expo/vector-icons';
import { data } from '../config/data';
```

Using the `Dimensions` API from React Native, let's define the initial width and height of the image component. In the code snippet below, I am calculating both the width and the height using the `width` of the screen.

```js
const { width } = Dimensions.get('screen');

const ITEM_WIDTH = width * 0.9;
const ITEM_HEIGHT = ITEM_WIDTH * 0.9;
```

The `HomeScreen` component is going to be a functional React component that accepts one prop called `navigation`. It will allow the navigation from the Home screen to the `DetailScreen`. In any React Native app, the React Navigation library provides a context that further gives access to the `navigation` object as a prop automatically. The prop contains various functions that dispatch navigation actions.

```js
export default function HomeScreen({ navigation }) {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#0f0f0f' }}>
      <StatusBar hidden />
      {/* Header */}
      <View style={{ marginTop: 50, marginBottom: 20, paddingHorizontal: 20 }}>
        <Text style={{ color: '#888', textTransform: 'uppercase' }}>
          Saturday 9 January
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ color: '#fff', fontSize: 32, fontWeight: '600' }}>
          Today
        </Text>
      </View>
  )
}
```

This functional component is going to render the header stating some dummy information to display and beneath it, a `ScrollView` to scroll through a list of images. Each image displays an icon and some information regarding what the image is about. This image and the text on it will play a huge role later when a transition is going to happen between the home and detail screen.

Inside the `ScrollView` component, let's render the mock data using JavaScript's `map()` method. If you are injecting data from a REST API that is hosted somewhere and you are not sure about the number of items in that particular data set, please use a `FlatList` component from React Native instead of `ScrollView`.

```js
return (
  {/* Scrollable content */}
<View style={{ flex: 1, paddingBottom: 20 }}>
  <ScrollView
    indicatorStyle='white'
    contentContainerStyle={{ alignItems: 'center' }}
  >
    {data.map(item => (
      <View key={item.id}>
        <TouchableOpacity
          activeOpacity={0.8}
          style={{ marginBottom: 14 }}
          onPress={() => navigation.navigate('DetailScreen', { item })}
        >
          <Image
            style={{
              borderRadius: 14,
              width: ITEM_WIDTH,
              height: ITEM_HEIGHT
            }}
            source={{ uri: item.image_url }}
            resizeMode='cover'
          />
          <View
            style={{
              position: 'absolute',
              bottom: 20,
              left: 10
            }}
          >
            <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row' }}>
              <SimpleLineIcons size={40} color='white' name={item.iconName} />
              <View style={{ flexDirection: 'column', paddingLeft: 6 }}>
                <Text
                  style={{
                    color: 'white',
                    fontSize: 24,
                    fontWeight: 'bold',
                    lineHeight: 28
                  }}
                >
                  {item.title}
                </Text>
                <Text
                  style={{
                    color: 'white',
                    fontSize: 16,
                    fontWeight: 'bold',
                    lineHeight: 18
                  }}
                >
                  {item.description}
                </Text>
              </View>
            </View>
          </View>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    ))}
  </ScrollView>
</View>);
```

## Create a detail screen

The `DetailScreen` component is going to render the details for each image that is part of the scroll list on the home screen. On this screen, an image is shown with a back navigation button that is positioned on the top of the screen. It receives the data in form of an `item` object that is destructured using `route.params` from React Navigation library. Beneath the image, it is going to show the title that will be shared with the home screen and some dummy text.

Create a new file called `DetailScreen.js` inside the `screens/` directory and add the following code snippet:

```js
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import {
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  View,
  ScrollView,
  Image,
  Dimensions
} from 'react-native';

import { SimpleLineIcons, MaterialCommunityIcons } from '@expo/vector-icons';

const { height } = Dimensions.get('window');
const ITEM_HEIGHT = height * 0.5;

const DetailScreen = ({ navigation, route }) => {
  const { item } = route.params;

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#0f0f0f' }}>
      <Image
        source={{ uri: item.image_url }}
        style={{
          width: '100%',
          height: ITEM_HEIGHT,
          borderBottomLeftRadius: 20,
          borderBottomRightRadius: 20
        }}
        resizeMode="cover"
      />
      <MaterialCommunityIcons
        name="close"
        size={28}
        color="#fff"
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          top: 40,
          right: 20,
          zIndex: 2
        }}
        onPress={() => {
          navigation.goBack();
        }}
      />
      <View
        style={{ flexDirection: 'row', marginTop: 10, paddingHorizontal: 20 }}
      >
        <SimpleLineIcons size={40} color="white" name={item.iconName} />
        <View style={{ flexDirection: 'column', paddingLeft: 6 }}>
          <Text
            style={{
              color: 'white',
              fontSize: 24,
              fontWeight: 'bold',
              lineHeight: 28
            }}
          >
            {item.title}
          </Text>
          <Text
            style={{
              color: 'white',
              fontSize: 16,
              fontWeight: 'bold',
              lineHeight: 18
            }}
          >
            {item.description}
          </Text>
        </View>
      </View>
      <ScrollView
        indicatorStyle="white"
        style={{
          paddingHorizontal: 20,
          backgroundColor: '#0f0f0f'
        }}
        contentContainerStyle={{ paddingVertical: 20 }}
      >
        <Text
          style={{
            fontSize: 18,
            color: '#fff',
            lineHeight: 24,
            marginBottom: 4
          }}
        >

        </Text>
      </ScrollView>
    </View>
  );
};

export default DetailScreen;
```

## Add navigation to the app

To navigate from the home screen to the detail screen and back, the app needs to have a navigation flow. This is going to be provided by `createSharedElementStackNavigator` method from `react-navigation-shared-element` module. It contains the React Navigation library for `react-native-shared-element`. This method allows us to create a stack-navigator which is the initial process of sharing elements between two separate screens. It wraps each route with the shared element and it detects route changes to trigger the transitions. The process of defining the navigation flow using this method is similar to React Navigation's stack-navigator module.

Create a new directory called `navigation/` and inside it create a new file called `RootNavigator.js`. Import the following statements and create an instance called `Stack` of the `createSharedElementStackNavigator` method. Then define the Root Navigator.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createSharedElementStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-shared-element';

import HomeScreen from '../screens/HomeScreen';
import DetailScreen from '../screens/DetailScreen';

const Stack = createSharedElementStackNavigator();

export default function RootNavigator() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator headerMode="none" initialRouteName="HomeScreen">
        <Stack.Screen name="HomeScreen" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="DetailScreen" component={DetailScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

To see it in action, modify the `App.js` file as shown below:

```js
import React from 'react';
import RootNavigator from './navigation/RootNavigator';

export default function App() {
  return <RootNavigator />;
}
```

Here is the result after this step in the iOS simulator:

## Shared element mapping

The image component is going to be responsible to support a seamless back and forth transition between home and detail screen. This transition should happen from the scroll grid to the detail screen and back to the relevant image. To make this happen, wrap the `Image` component with `<SharedElement>` and provide a unique `id` to it in the `HomeScreen`.

Also, make sure to import the `<SharedElement>` component from the `react-navigation-shared-element` module.

```js
import { SharedElement } from 'react-navigation-shared-element';

// Wrap the image component as
return (
  // ...

  <SharedElement id={`item.${item.id}.image_url`}>
    <Image
      style={{
        borderRadius: 14,
        width: ITEM_WIDTH,
        height: ITEM_HEIGHT
      }}
      source={{ uri: item.image_url }}
      resizeMode="cover"
    />
  </SharedElement>
);
```

The `<SharedElement>` component accepts a prop called `id` that is the shared id between the two screens. The child it is wrapped around is the actual component where the transition happens.

To enable the shared element transitions, the above process has to be followed in `DetailScreen`.

```js
import { SharedElement } from 'react-navigation-shared-element';

// Wrap the image component as
return (
  // ...
  <SharedElement id={`item.${item.id}.image_url`}>
    <Image
      source={{ uri: item.image_url }}
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: ITEM_HEIGHT,
        borderBottomLeftRadius: 20,
        borderBottomRightRadius: 20
      }}
      resizeMode="cover"
    />
  </SharedElement>
);
```

To animate the transition between the home and the detail screens, define a `sharedElements` configuration in the `DetailScreen` component. This will map the transition of the `Image` component between the two screens.

Before the `export` statement in `DetailScreen.js` add the code snippet:

```js
DetailScreen.sharedElements = route => {
  const { item } = route.params;
  return [
    {
      id: `item.${item.id}.image_url`,
      animation: 'move',
      resize: 'clip'
    }
  ];
};
```

The config object above triggers the transition effects on shared elements between screens based on the unique ID shared between those two screens. This is done by defining a property called `id`.

The property `animation` determines how the animation is going to happen when navigating between two screens. For example, in the above code snippet, the `animation` has a value called `move`. It is also the default value of this property. There are other values available such as `fade`, `fade-in`, and `fade-out`. The property `resize` is the behavior that determines the shape and size of the element should be modified or not. For example, in the above snippet, the value `clip` adds a transition effect which is similar to a text reveal effect.

Here is the output after this step:

![lg3](https://i.imgur.com/qzCGF2F.gif)

In the above example, please note that when the transition happens, the screen slides from left to right in between. To modify this behavior to apply transition effects of the shared elements, let's add an `options` configuration object to the `DetailScreen`. In Root Navigator file, add the following configuration:

```js
const options = {
  headerBackTitleVisible: false,
  cardStyleInterpolator: ({ current: { progress } }) => {
    return {
      cardStyle: {
        opacity: progress
      }
    };
  }
};

// Then add it to the DetailScreen

return (
  <Stack.Screen
    name="DetailScreen"
    component={DetailScreen}
    options={() => options}
  />
);
```

The `cardStyleInterpolator` function specifies the interpolated styles for different parts of a card. It allows us to customize the transitions when navigating between two screens. It receives a property value called `current.progress` that represents the animated node progress value of the current screen. Applying this value to the property `opacity` changes the animated node to the value of animation defined in the shared element config object. Its `cardStyle` property applies the style on the view that is representing the card.

## Update Shared elements mapping

In the previous demonstration, you can see that the transition on the image component is seamless but other components shared such as the location pin icon, the title and the description of the item between two screens is not.

To resolve this, let's map them using `<SharedElement>` component. First, in home screen, modify the following components:

```js
return (
  // Icon
  <SharedElement id={`item.${item.id}.iconName`}>
    <SimpleLineIcons size={40} color='white' name={item.iconName} />
  </SharedElement>

  //Title
  <SharedElement id={`item.${item.id}.title`}>
  <Text
    style={{
      color: 'white',
      fontSize: 24,
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      lineHeight: 28
    }}
  >
    {item.title}
  </Text>
</SharedElement>

  // Description
  <SharedElement id={`item.${item.id}.description`}>
  <Text
    style={{
      color: 'white',
      fontSize: 16,
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      lineHeight: 18
    }}
  >
    {item.description}
  </Text>
</SharedElement>
);
```

Similarly, modify the following elements in `DetailScreen.js` file:

```js
// Icon
<SharedElement id={`item.${item.id}.iconName`}>
  <SimpleLineIcons size={40} color='white' name={item.iconName} />
</SharedElement>

// Title
<SharedElement id={`item.${item.id}.title`}>
  <Text
    style={{
      color: 'white',
      fontSize: 24,
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      lineHeight: 28
    }}
  >
    {item.title}
  </Text>
</SharedElement>

// Description
<SharedElement id={`item.${item.id}.description`}>
  <Text
    style={{
      color: 'white',
      fontSize: 16,
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      lineHeight: 18
    }}
  >
    {item.description}
  </Text>
</SharedElement>
```

Then add the configuration:

```js
DetailScreen.sharedElements = route => {
  const { item } = route.params;
  return [
    {
      id: `item.${item.id}.image_url`,
      animation: 'move',
      resize: 'clip'
    },
    {
      id: `item.${item.id}.title`,
      animation: 'fade',
      resize: 'clip'
    },
    {
      id: `item.${item.id}.description`,
      animation: 'fade',
      resize: 'clip'
    },
    {
      id: `item.${item.id}.iconName`,
      animation: 'move',
      resize: 'clip'
    }
  ];
};
```

Here is the output after this step:

## Delayed loading

Shared element transitions are a great way to support a smooth end-user experience but it can become tricky when dealing with elements that need to be loaded before or after the transition happens. For example, in the previous demonstration, the back button renders before the transition happens. To control its behavior, let's animate it using the React Native Animatable library.

Import it inside the `DetailScreen.js` file:

```js
import * as Animatable from 'react-native-animatable';
```

The close button icon is going to be wrapped inside the `<Animatable.View>`. This component has a prop called `delay` that delays the animation. Using a prop called `duration` you can control the amount of time the animation will run. Values to both of these props are provided in milliseconds. Using a `ref` value, the `fadeOut` animation is applied on the icon. This animation method is asynchronous and thus, you can use the promise to navigate back to the home screen after the animation has successfully run. The argument passed to this animation method is in milliseconds.

```js
const DetailScreen = ({ navigation, route }) => {
  const buttonRef = React.useRef();

  return (
    <Animatable.View
      ref={buttonRef}
      animation="fadeIn"
      duration={600}
      delay={300}
      style={[StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject]}
    >
      <MaterialCommunityIcons
        name="close"
        size={28}
        color="#fff"
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          top: 40,
          right: 20,
          zIndex: 2
        }}
        onPress={() => {
          buttonRef.current.fadeOut(100).then(() => {
            navigation.goBack();
          });
        }}
      />
    </Animatable.View>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

I hope you had fun reading this tutorial. Sharing elements in between screens in React Native using the React Navigation Shared Element module makes both the process of development and end-user experience smooth. I would recommend you to check out the [official documentation here](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-navigation-shared-element) for more information.
