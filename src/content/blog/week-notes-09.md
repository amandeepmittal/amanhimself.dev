Another week, another set of notes.

- Completed the llms.txt project at work. Now, all areas of documentation have their llms.txt files generated. I am using custom scripts, and the challenging part was navigating the SDK documentation. After trying different methods to achieve an output level without missing any information, I decided to use a third-party library called [sitefetch](https://github.com/egoist/sitefetch) instead of writing my own script for the SDK docs. Yes, it does make network calls, but that isn't a trade-off in this situation. Fetching data from over 90 SDK pages only takes a minute, considering the amount of data rendered on those pages.
- 📝 Shared how to change the PICO-8 cart storage location on macOS. I wrote a draft about excluding certain JSX components from Vale to prevent them from being linted. This use case is common when MDX is employed to manage Markdown text within a documentation's source code.
- 📚 Completed reading Good Habits, Bad Habits by Wendy Wood and completed 3 Sakamoto Days volumes.
- 👾 Continued playing Octopath Traveller 2 for a little while. Not much progress.
