Recently, I was looking at my blog analytics for 2025 in [fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/) and I have some thoughts to share.

62,500 unique visitors. 77,400 page views. I've been writing posts for years now and it always feel nice when people read them. If you are reading them, thank you!

Here's the thing that blows my mind though. My top post is about stashing changes in VS Code. I wrote about it when I stumbled upon the the side panels in VS Code. I didn't know that many people are thinking and searching for the same. Meanwhile, the most elaborated posts on my blog are nowhere near this one.

I guess, that's the nature of blogging.

The top 10 most visited pages are mostly problem-solution oriented this year:

- How to stash in VS Code (the champion)
- MacBook setup 2025
- Opening folders from Terminal in Finder
- Converting PNGs to JPGs with ffmpeg
- Hiding files with chflags
- Obsidian folder settings
- Installing Node with nvm
- Expo Router Large header titles
- iOS Simulator touch indicators
- Create a custom scrollbar with React Native Animated API

These are all the things you can Google in the middle of something else when you need the thing you are working on, to work. I don't think anyone is browsing these posts for fun.

Now, let's see where the traffic comes from because this is genuinely interesting:

```text
Google:        41,900 views (54%)
Direct:        24,900 views (32%)
Yandex:         2,400 views
Bing:           2,100 views
DuckDuckGo:     1,300 views
Twitter/X:      1,100 views
GitHub:           310 views
LinkedIn:         181 views
```

Google is doing all the heavy lifting here. Social media is basically a rounding error. X (Twitter) brought 1,100 readers total for the entire year. And that's because of one post: "Expo Router Large header titles", which was shared by the official Expo account. I have stopped posting on socials whenever I publish something new on this blog.

This is kind of liberating actually. I don't need to "build an audience" or "engage on the platform" or whatever. I just need to write stuff because I enjoy doing it.

A lesson I have learned about [blogging for 10 years](/blog/lessons-from-10-years-of-blogging/) is that the post you least expect to have an audience, compounds over time.

My key takeaway: **Write the posts you wish existed when you googled the problem.**

Anyway. 62,500 people found something useful here in 2025. That's pretty cool!
